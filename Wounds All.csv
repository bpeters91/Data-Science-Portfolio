Then we heard the dervishes breaking the private door [of Gordon’s apartment], while the Pasha was loading his revolver. I went forward and received a little wound in the face; and when the Pasha came, he received a wound in the left shoulder. The man who wounded him was a half-blood slave. We followed them to [head clerk] Roushdi Bey’s room, killing three and wounding many, and the others ran away and fell down the stairs. We went back to the Pasha’s room and reloaded, but the dervishes came back, and I received a slight wound in my right leg from a sword; but I warded the blow, and the cut was nothing. We attacked the dervishes on the private stairs; and while we were passing the door, a native of Khartoum, dressed as a dervish, stabbed the Pasha with a spear on the left shoulder. Seeing this man’s hand coming from behind the door, I cut at it; and he ran and fell on a spear held by one of his companions on the steps, and was killed. At this time, more dervishes were coming along the corridor; and we returned to meet them. I received a thrust in the left hand; but the Pasha cut the man down with his sword, and kicked him on the head, and he died. Then the dervishes ran into the clerks’ offices; and while we were standing in the corridor, a tall Negro fired a shot from the door near Roushdi Bey’s room, and the bullet struck the Pasha in the right breast; and the Pasha ran up and shot the man dead. The dervishes then came out of the offices; and we turned, and they ran to the private stairs; and we fired into them, but the Pasha was getting weak from loss of blood. We fought these dervishes down the stairs till we reached the last one, and a native of Katimeh speared the Pasha in the right hip, but I shot him; and the Pasha fell down on the mat at the door [of the guard room], and he was dead; and as I turned to seek refuge in the finance office, I was struck down and lost my senses, and I was lying down with the dead.

The officer, having emptied his revolver, drew his sword. The Zulu came at him with his shield up, turning and springing from side to side as he advanced. Presently he lowered the shield, exposing his head; and the white man, falling into the trap, aimed a fierce blow at it. As it fell, the shield was raised again; and the sword sank deep into its edge, remaining fixed in the tough ox hide. This was what the Zulu desired. With a twist of his strong arm, he wrenched the sword from his opponent’s hand; and in another instant, the unfortunate officer was down with an assegai [spear] through his breast.” (H.

When the Frenchman saw him coming, he dropped his firelock and cried ‘Prisonnier’; but galloping past, with one switch of his sword, the captain took the top of the man’s head clean off. Whilst I had been standing in the position described above, another Frenchman, minus his bayonet, had snapped his firelock three times in my face; but it did not go off.

I suppose I had swerved my mare a little to the left to save her shoulder; but notwithstanding that, the shock nearly threw me out of the saddle. Another thing was that Peggy had snapped, as she galloped up, at the neck of the French horse, and held a piece of it between her teeth. Then there was such a shaking of manes and prancing that we human fighters had as much as we could do to keep our seats. The cuirassier was grinding his teeth and swearing in his foreign way; for every cut which he aimed at Peggy, to make her loose her hold, was parried by me immediately—though the force of the blows, which numbed my arm to the shoulder, showed me that I had no chicken to deal with. At length, the French horse set himself free; but for all that, I could get no nearer to his master, as the creatures commenced rearing and sparring with their feet like boxers. Finally (I do not know whether to be proud or sorry), a sudden plunge of Peggy placed me above the Frenchman, and enabled me to cut him in the face with a back-hander. He sank stupefied on his horse’s neck, and I saw no more of him.",Europe

With our light horses, we might as well have charged against a stone wall as against those cuirassiers. We were forced back by sheer weight. In retreating, I found myself alongside Joe Coblins. ‘Captain’s taken,’ said Joe. ‘And Sam?’ I asked. ‘Down, and cut to pieces,’ was the reply. ‘Look there!’ It was poor Sam’s riderless horse, aligning with me, the saddle red with blood. ‘Look out!’ shouted Joe. It was time I did look out; for the next moment, my brass chinstrap, and half my left ear with it, was divided by a crappo [French] cuirassier, who was cutting at me over Sam’s horse, as if I had been a round of beef. One of my holster pistols settled that gentleman—greatly to my relief—for I could not have done it with my sword arm.” (“A Reminiscence of Waterloo,” a.k.a. “The Story of a Recruit,” Falmouth & Penryn Weekly Times, Apr. 20, 1872, and several other newspapers; reprinted from The People’s Magazine.)",Europe

Why I was so lenient with this man I do not know, for he deserved death at my hands as much as the other; but I merely gave him a sabre cut on the inside of the right arm, which made him drop his pistol; and he was unarmed. The other man I disarmed, and drove them both over the side; but as they did not seem to move as fast as I thought they ought, I gave them about an inch or two of the point of my sword, which quickened their pace wonderfully.
“All this did not appear to have taken up more than a minute of time, and we were in complete possession of the afterpart of the vessel. Three of the boats boarded forward, where there was a good deal of firing going on; and, as the quarterdeck was clear, I mounted the paddlebox and gave orders for the firing to cease immediately, fearing, from the darkness of the night, we might take friends for foes; and Lieutenant McCormick had already received a desperate wound.

The large man said, ‘Damn you,’ made a cut at me, which I guarded with my cutlass; he then drew a pistol from his belt and fired at me at about two yards’ distance. Three balls went through my wrist, one through my arm, and another struck me in the chest; and I at the same time received a sabre cut from one of the other men upon the loin. I staggered back about a yard before I recovered myself, and then made a cut at the principal assailant, which took effect on his head and stretched him on the deck. The others then ran off.

Showing me a large sword, which cut off his [left] arm at Bhurtpore [in 1826] when leading his men to the assault, he said that on the rampart a giant [Khusiyal Singh, a Jat chief] in complete armour, whirling his sword, met him. Hunter held his sword up in defence; but to use his own words, ‘The giant sent it with a whirr into the air.’ Hunter then held up the scabbard; but the blow went through it and his arm, just below the elbow, leaving merely a bit of skin uncut. He fell sitting, and held his severed arm in his right hand while an officer tied a sash above the wound to stop the hæmorrhage; then a surgeon came up, put the two ends together and tied them, and they united! However, he cannot use it; and sometimes it flies about involuntarily with a circular motion, until he catches it with his hand, which is not always easy, poor fellow! His soldiers took a long time to kill the giant, his armour was so strong, and he laid about him like a madman.” (Lt. Gen. Sir W.

Jim McGraw disposed of the other by shooting him through the body with the musket of the third man, who was kneeling on Andy’s shoulders. Him they did not kill, but just disabled. The Sergeant forgets precisely how; his impression is that Jim McGraw just ran him somewhere through the shoulder or the leg.” (Walter Frith, “Sergeant Conway,” The Cornhill Magazine, Vol. XIX, 1905.)",Europe

The mutineer jumped aside and evaded the thrust, and at the same time catching the musket under his left arm, aimed a blow at Flynn’s head; but the latter’s impetus had been so great that the two men appeared locked in each other’s arms, so that the hilt of the mutineer’s sword came on Flynn’s head; who, half stunned, dropped his musket, and at the same time slightly falling back, gave his enemy a straight hit between the eyes which sent him head over heels; and before he could recover himself, Money ran his sword through him. In a short time, the bastion was ours.” (The History of the Bengal European Regiment, 1885.)

Stokes’s Pathan Horse (a.k.a. Stokes’s Irregular Cavalry), regarding his near-fatal encounter during an attack on a fortified village between Meerut and Delhi in 1857: “As I was passing a kind of empty outhouse, a man rushed out and fired a pistol at me; the ball passed my ear, and he then cut at me with his tulwar—at the moment, I was away from my men. He had a shield, which guarded my sword cuts, and I in turn did all I could to keep his off. At last, he managed to get inside my guard; and then I received a six-inch wound in the upper part of my arm. As my sword fell from my hand, I knew that the motion of the arm had gone. I felt in my holsters with my left hand, but could not get my pistols out in time; so, finding my case most desperate and the fellow about to strike me again, I leaped off my horse on him (he was on foot) and clasped him round the neck with my left hand, calling on my sowars to help me; but before they could come up, he had managed to untwine himself, and in a moment dealt me two blows, one on the forehead and one on the head. I fell backwards; and as the blood poured over my face, I had just time to see one of our men make a furious rush at him and cut him down. He was a plucky fellow; and as he laid beside me, I saw he belonged to the 9th Irregular Cavalry, and had two medals.

James Rennell, of the Bengal Engineers, regarding his encounter with insurgents in 1766 while surveying the British East India Company’s territories in Bengal and serving as a volunteer with his military escort: “Two other officers and myself went to reconnoitre a village, although we hardly believed that any of the enemy were there, and suddenly found ourselves in front of two lines of them, drawn up in the market place. Our escort of a few horse thought it high time to retreat; but we thought it rather too late, for the enemy had drawn their sabres and surrounded us. One of the officers had the good fortune to escape unhurt; another, an engineer officer under me, escaped with a slight wound after fighting his way through. As for myself, I was so entirely surrounded that I never expected to escape; but having the good fortune to preserve my sword, I defended myself pretty well in front and kept retreating backwards till I had very few behind me, when I turned and fled for it. A hardy fellow followed me close, but paid the price of his life for it; the rest of them, thinking I was too much wounded to run far, remained in their places, but kept a continual firing on me till I was out of sight. None of the balls, however, hit me. Providence must have strengthened my arms whilst I was retreating, for now I found both of them deprived of their strength; and, indeed, no wonder; for one of them was cut in three places, and the shoulder bone belonging to the other divided. One stroke of a sabre had cut my [right] shoulder bone through and laid me open for nearly a foot down the back, wounding several of the ribs, besides a stab in the same arm and a large cut in the hand, which has deprived me of the use of my forefinger.” (Maj. Gen. Whitworth Porter, History of the Corps of Royal Engineers, 1889.)

In another letter, Rennell noted that besides the wounds mentioned in the previous letter, he had “a cut on the left elbow which took off the muscular part of the breadth of a hand” and “a large cut on the head”. He also noted that his pistol “flashed in the pan”, leaving him with “only a short sword” to defend himself. (Col. Henry Yule & A. C. Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, 1903.) Rennell’s biographer, Clements R. Markham, added: “There were some other slighter wounds, and a large cut across the back of his coat was found when it was taken off. It was, fortunately, a thick regimental coat; but if he had happened to have been wearing his usual thin clothing, this cut would probably have terminated his existence. By very slow degrees he recovered the use of his limbs; but he never had the perfect use of his right arm again, nor the forefinger of his left hand, while the loss of blood permanently injured his constitution. ‘My companions,’ he wrote, ‘thought it almost miraculous that I have escaped so well.’” (Major James Rennell, 1895.) Incidentally, the officer who commanded the escort managed to rally them and “made an attack on the enemy and cut most of them to pieces”. (Yule & Burnell, op. cit.)",Asia

One of the officers had the good fortune to escape unhurt; another, an engineer officer under me, escaped with a slight wound after fighting his way through. As for myself, I was so entirely surrounded that I never expected to escape; but having the good fortune to preserve my sword, I defended myself pretty well in front and kept retreating backwards till I had very few behind me, when I turned and fled for it. A hardy fellow followed me close, but paid the price of his life for it; the rest of them, thinking I was too much wounded to run far, remained in their places, but kept a continual firing on me till I was out of sight. None of the balls, however, hit me. Providence must have strengthened my arms whilst I was retreating, for now I found both of them deprived of their strength; and, indeed, no wonder; for one of them was cut in three places, and the shoulder bone belonging to the other divided. One stroke of a sabre had cut my [right] shoulder bone through and laid me open for nearly a foot down the back, wounding several of the ribs, besides a stab in the same arm and a large cut in the hand, which has deprived me of the use of my forefinger.” (Maj. Gen. Whitworth Porter, History of the Corps of Royal Engineers, 1889.)

In another letter, Rennell noted that besides the wounds mentioned in the previous letter, he had “a cut on the left elbow which took off the muscular part of the breadth of a hand” and “a large cut on the head”. He also noted that his pistol “flashed in the pan”, leaving him with “only a short sword” to defend himself. (Col. Henry Yule & A. C. Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, 1903.) Rennell’s biographer, Clements R. Markham, added: “There were some other slighter wounds, and a large cut across the back of his coat was found when it was taken off. It was, fortunately, a thick regimental coat; but if he had happened to have been wearing his usual thin clothing, this cut would probably have terminated his existence. By very slow degrees he recovered the use of his limbs; but he never had the perfect use of his right arm again, nor the forefinger of his left hand, while the loss of blood permanently injured his constitution. ‘My companions,’ he wrote, ‘thought it almost miraculous that I have escaped so well.’” (Major James Rennell, 1895.)

Lieutenant Smith permitted him; and the gallant fellow was soon on his horse, with his sword only, and rode out to do battle. I have heard that the sight of the two combatants trying to gain the sword hand of his adversary was most beautiful and exciting.

At last, some began to give way; and their commander, or one of their principal officers, attempted to rally them. Having succeeded in this attempt for the moment, the said officer had the impudence to attack and put His Majesty’s liege subject, John Shipp, ensign on full pay, and in the full vigour of his life and manhood, in bodily fear. He was a strong powerful man, protected by two shields, one tied round his waist and hanging over his thighs as low as his knees, and the other on the left arm, much larger than the one round his waist. From this gentleman there was no escape; and, fortunately for me, I had my old twenty-fourther [24th Dragoons sabre] with me, which I had two or three days before put in good shaving order. With this I was obliged to act on the defensive, till I could catch my formidable opponent off his guard. He cut, I guarded; he thrust, I parried; until he became aggravated and set to work with that impetuosity and determination pretty generally understood by the phrase ‘hammer and tongs’; in the course of which he nearly cut my poor twenty-fourther in pieces. At last I found he was winded, but I could see nothing of the fellow but his face peeping above one shield and his feet under the other; so I thought I would give him a ‘cut five’ across his lower extremities. But he would not stand still a moment; he cut as many capers as a French dancing master, till I was quite out of patience with his folly. I did not like to quit my man, so I tried his other extremities; but he would not stand still, all I could do. At length, I made a feint at his toes, to cut them; down went his shield from his face to save his legs; up went the edge of my sword smack under his chin—in endeavouring to get away from which, he threw his head back, which nearly tumbled off, and down he fell; and I assure you, reader, I was not sorry for it; for he was a most unsociable neighbour.

“I don’t know whether I had a right or not, but I took the liberty of taking his sword, gold crescent, turban chain, and large shield. The latter I sported on my left arm during the action, and it was fortunate for me that I did; for I found that the shield was ball proof, and I should have been severely wounded had I been deprived of this trophy. The enemy fought furiously before they gave up; and on going round afterwards, I paid a visit to the dead body of my antagonist. I found that his head hung only by the skin of his neck. He had also a cut in the abdomen, through which the bowels protruded. He was a fine-looking man; and when engaged with him, I never dared take my eye off his. Had I not been thoroughly practised in the sword exercise, I must soon have fallen; for he was a very expert swordsman. In a letter addressed to me afterwards by Captain Pickersgill, quartermaster general of the army, I was congratulated on the fall of that distinguished sobah or chieftain.” (Memoirs of John Shipp, 1829.)",Asia

Hearsey (6th Bengal Cavalry) regarding his single combat, when he was a lieutenant and adjutant of the 6th, at Seetabuldee during the Mahratta War in 1817: “Our column of threes were soon among the enemy, who turned and fled. The commandant of the enemy’s artillery, who was loath to turn and fly, stopped near the banks of the Nag Nuddee [Snake River]. I charged at him, sword in hand; he stood boldly to receive me. He was armed with a long double-edged sword pointed at the handle, and so formed that both hands could be used in wielding it. The blade was at least four feet long. This weapon is called by the natives a ‘syfe’, and it is a most formidable weapon. I made a sad mistake in attempting to ride by him and cut him down, whereas a horseman attacking a bold and resolute man on foot should always attempt to ride over him. The consequence was that he escaped the blow; and I had made such a swoop, leaning over to my right side, that the point of my sword was partly buried in the ground; and ere I had time to regain my saddle, he had given me a fearful wound over my head and neck. My orderly-trooper, a young Rajpoot, before he [the commandant] had time to recover the blow or defend himself, struck him over his head with his sabre and felled him to the earth; but, like all the Mahratta chiefs, his head was doubly shielded from harm. His turban was worn twined in the usual manner round the temples and back of the head, and was in many folds of cloth. Besides this, he had another turban going over his head and under his chin, making some thirty plies of folded cloth to be cut through. The orderly found that the blow had not been effectual; and I heard him say, ‘You have killed my master, my commander, my officer, my father; and I’ll put you to death.’ Saying this, he drew a pistol from his holster and shot the man through the body, setting fire to his cotton jacket, which, communicating with his powder horn, blew his body to atoms.” (Col. Hugh Pearse, The Hearseys, 1905.)

He was described as a very powerful young man, and an expert and dashing swordsman; and in the affray, many of the adverse cavaliers had bit the dust under his puissant blade. Among the rest, he dismissed to the shades below an ancient grey-bearded warrior who was fighting ‘ενι προμαχοισι’ [in the front ranks] with his son, a young Arab [partisan], by his side. The English officer pursued his career in search of fresh conquests; but the youth had seen his father fall, and bent on pious vengeance, followed his destroyer over the whole field. At length he came up with him, just as he was retiring, the last among his troop. They met for an instant; the Arab’s sword, urged on by revenge, pierced the Englishman’s side, and he fell from his horse; whilst the appeased son, uttering a shout of triumph, flew back to seek his sire’s body.” (Pen and Pencil Sketches, 1832.)

Hussein took the bait, raised the shield to his head, and made a desperate cut; but he had not calculated on the very disproportionate length of his opponent, who quickly drew back the advanced limb, avoiding the sweep of the weapon, made a feint cut at the head, and the next moment buried his sword to the hilt in the loins of the unfortunate Hussein Khan.

Robert (“Fighting Bob”) Sale, commander of the 1st Bengal Brigade of the Rangoon Expedition, during the Burmese War in 1824: “The Burmans were disputing obstinately a succession of retrenchments. The British and the Burmans contended for a few minutes hand to hand. Here a singular combat took place. A Burman chief singled out a soldier of the 13th [Light Infantry]. He aimed a blow at his head. Major Sale, who was near, interposing his own sabre, parried the cut. He in his turn made a cut at the chief. The blow caused the Burman to stagger, but the major’s sabre shivered like glass to the very hilt. Instantly closing with his enemy, he wrested from him his broad gilded weapon, and striking the Burman with his full force below the ribs, nearly severed his body into two portions. The conflict was too close to be of long duration. The last retrenchment was forced with terrific slaughter.” (Memoir of the Three Campaigns in Ava, 1828.)",Asia

Skilled in the feints and artifice of Eastern swordsmanship, and understanding the superiority of my own straight cut-and-thrust blade, I bore the onset and had wounded my second adversary in the sword arm before he could complete his first ineffectual blow; for, skilful as they are in warding the edge of the sword, the point is never used by them, nor anticipated in their encounter with others. [Not according to other accounts!] Still, the task of avoiding the blows of two swords at once was most arduous and critical, and had not circumstances favoured me, would probably have ended in my destruction. But my first adversary had fallen upon a broken bale of cotton which lay across the rampart, and which, together with his body, rendered it difficult for either of the enemy to press hard upon me without manifest exposure of their own persons in surmounting the obstacle, trifling as was its height. Making the most of this fortunate barrier, with a quickness of eye and rapidity of action that gave no leisure for aught but self-defence to my foes, I had not only escaped hitherto with a trifling wound in the shoulder, but perceived from the blood that streamed over the quilted tunics of the natives, and the languor of their descending arms, that my sword had not been used in vain. Pretending now to be exclusively occupied with my foe on the left, the other was encouraged to step upon the intervening obstacle with the view of surmounting it and taking me in flank; but secretly observing his movements, without turning my head, I dealt him so sudden and unexpected a blow that the sinews of both legs were severed at once; and he fell helpless down the rampart into the street of the town.

“Ere the other could recover his shaken nerves, I had leaped the barrier, had closed within his guard, and was in the act of throwing him to the earth when I felt my own feet struck from under me; and clasping with my arms this fresh assailant, all three rolled heavily together to the earth, writhing and struggling for the mastery. But, though stronger than either of my foes individually, I felt how hopeless is the strife of one man against two—of two arms and legs against four of either—when grappling in such close encounter. Helplessly extended on my back, I saw, with a feeling which all have experienced in their dreams, my new enemy rise from the earth, his foot still planted on my neck, and raise the fatal scimitar to complete the achievement. I panted for breath, collected my thoughts with the intense energy of despair, remembered the second pistol still loaded in my belt—my right hand, though fettered, lay almost upon it—I drew it eagerly from its rest, turned it with a motion of my wrist, pressed the small but important spring. The heavy sword flew from the descending arm; it pierced the breast it was intended to save. The death groan burst simultaneously from both my late opponents. The limbs, clasped around me like the folds of a serpent, relaxed and no longer impeded my own.

One of their number brought down Brigadier Sale by a cut in the face with his sharp shumsheer (Asiatic sabre). The Afghan repeated his blow as his opponent was falling; but the pommel, not the edge of his sword, this time took effect, though with stunning violence. He lost his footing, however, in the effort; and Briton and Afghan rolled together. Thus situated, the first care of the brigadier was to master the weapon of his adversary. He snatched at it, but one of his fingers met the edge of the trenchant blade. He quickly withdrew his wounded hand, and adroitly replaced it over that of his adversary, so as to keep fast the hilt of his shumsheer. But he had an active and powerful opponent, and was himself faint from loss of blood. Captain Kershaw, of the 13th [Light Infantry], happened in the mêlée to approach the scene of conflict; the wounded leader recognised and called to him for aid. Kershaw passed his drawn sabre through the body of the Afghan, but still the desperado continued to struggle with frantic violence. At length, in the fierce grapple, the brigadier for a moment got uppermost. Still retaining the weapon of his enemy in his left hand, he dealt him, with his right, a cut from his own sabre, which cleft his skull from the crown to the eyebrows. The Afghan shouted, ‘Oh, God!’, and never spoke or moved again. The leader of the column regained his feet, and feeling himself for the moment incapable of personal exertion, yet calmly directed the movements of his men, who, after a fierce struggle, in which many ghastly wounds were exchanged, had now established themselves within the walls [of Ghuznee].” (Narrative of the War in Affghanistan, 1840.)

Robert (“Fighting Bob”) Sale, commander of the 1st Bengal Brigade of the Army of the Indus, at the storming of Ghuznee during the Afghan War in 1839: “The encounter with these desperate men [Afghans] was terrific. One of their number brought down Brigadier Sale by a cut in the face with his sharp shumsheer (Asiatic sabre). The Afghan repeated his blow as his opponent was falling; but the pommel, not the edge of his sword, this time took effect, though with stunning violence. He lost his footing, however, in the effort; and Briton and Afghan rolled together. Thus situated, the first care of the brigadier was to master the weapon of his adversary. He snatched at it, but one of his fingers met the edge of the trenchant blade. He quickly withdrew his wounded hand, and adroitly replaced it over that of his adversary, so as to keep fast the hilt of his shumsheer. But he had an active and powerful opponent, and was himself faint from loss of blood. Captain Kershaw, of the 13th [Light Infantry], happened in the mêlée to approach the scene of conflict; the wounded leader recognised and called to him for aid. Kershaw passed his drawn sabre through the body of the Afghan, but still the desperado continued to struggle with frantic violence. At length, in the fierce grapple, the brigadier for a moment got uppermost. Still retaining the weapon of his enemy in his left hand, he dealt him, with his right, a cut from his own sabre, which cleft his skull from the crown to the eyebrows.

Sir Orfeur Cavenagh, Bengal Staff Corps: “During the first war in Afghanistan, a troop of the 4th Regiment I.C. [Bengal Irregular Cavalry], whilst escorting stores through one of the passes in Beloochistan [in 1839], was attacked by a large body of the enemy. As the latter were on foot and crowned the heights, from which they poured down a heavy fire, there being no infantry with the convoy, the native officer in command immediately dismounted half his troop, and putting himself at their head, sword in hand, ascended the hill, himself singling out the Beloochi leader, who engaged with him in single combat. Both were good swordsmen; but the Beloochi chief, a powerful man, had the advantage of being on the upper ground. The native officer, after some time, found himself overmatched, when he suddenly called out, as if to someone behind his opponent, ‘Kill the rascal!’ The ruse succeeded. The Beloochi, naturally thinking that one of the troopers had got in his rear, turned his head for a moment to ascertain the position of his new enemy. That movement was fatal. By a sweep from the native officer’s sabre, his head was separated from his body; and the Beloochis, seeing their leader fall, retired.” (Reminiscences of an Indian Official, 1884.)

Dr. James Atkinson, superintending surgeon of the Army of the Indus, wrote a slightly different account of this incident: “A loud shout rung through the camp; and on inquiring, I found that an exploit had been performed among the Beloochees, and two heads had been brought in. A party of them had been carrying off some camels at graze, after attacking and wounding the sarwans [camel drivers]. Four sowars [troopers] were immediately despatched to the spot and overtook the robbers, who fired at them twice, but without effect. The sowars then rode up to them and closed, to prevent a third loading. The wurdee major [adjutant], who commanded, now got into a parley with one of the Beloochees, who had the vantage ground, flourishing his sword on an eminence and uttering words of defiance. The sowar, as shrewd as he was fearless, suddenly dismounted, and springing up the rock, called out, as if to his comrade, ‘Shoot him!’ The Beloochee, turning round to see what threatened him, his bare neck became exposed; and the sowar, seizing the opportunity thus contrived, with one furious stroke of his heavy sword, severed his head from his body. The other head [brought back to camp by the troopers] was that of an older man. A third was killed, but the sword broke short in the skull; and tumbling down the crags, the head could not be got at to be brought into the camp. The rest escaped among the hills.” (The Expedition into Affghanistan, 1842.)",Asia

As it was, a piece of bone about the size of a wafer was cut from my skull; and I was nearly stunned, but managed to rise on my knee; and seeing that a second blow was coming, I met it with the edge of my sword, and I suppose cut off some of my assailant’s fingers, as his knife fell to the ground. He bolted one way and I the other, minus my horse, cap, and one of my shoes; and I got a severe blow on the shoulder from a fellow who rushed down from the hill and across the road. Soon after, I overtook a Hindoostanee mochee (saddler) of the Shah’s cavalry, who told me he was dying and begged me to take his pony or someone else would. I tried to encourage him; but he fell off, and I found the poor fellow was shot through the chest and dead. I then mounted his pony, and shortly came in sight of the village of Futtehabad. The villagers fired on us, and cavalry charged among us. One fellow cut at me, which I guarded, and he then cut down poor [Lieutenant] Bird; and it became a case of utter rout.

“I proceeded alone for a short distance, unmolested; then I saw a party of about twenty men drawn up in my road, who when I came near, began picking up large stones, with which the plain abounded; so I with difficulty put my pony into a gallop, and taking the bridle in my teeth, cut right and left with my sword as I went through them. They could not reach me with their knives, and I was only hit by one or two stones. A little further on I was met by another similar party, who I tried to pass as I did the former, but was obliged to prick the poor pony with the point of my sword before I could get him into a gallop. Of this party, one man on a mound over the road had a gun, which he fired close down upon me; and a large stone broke my sword, leaving about six inches in the handle. But I got clear of them, and then found that the shot had hit the poor pony, wounding him in the loins; and he could now hardly carry me. But I moved on very slowly and saw some fine horsemen, dressed in red. Supposing they were some of our irregular cavalry, I made towards them, but found they were Afghans. So I tried to get away, but my pony could hardly move; and they sent one of their party after me, who made a cut at me which I, guarding with the bit of my sword, it fell from the hilt. He passed me, but turned and rode at me again. This time, just as he was striking, I threw the handle of the sword at his head, in swerving to avoid which he only cut me over the back of the left hand. Feeling it disabled, I stretched down the right to pick up the bridle. I suppose my foe thought it was for a pistol, for he turned at once and made off as quick as he could.

“I then felt for the pistol I had put in my pocket, but it was gone; and I was unarmed, wounded, and on a poor animal I feared could not carry me to [the British outpost at] Jellalabad, though it was now in sight. Suddenly all energy seemed to forsake me; I became nervous and frightened at shadows; and I really think I should have fallen from my saddle but for the peak of it, and some of our people from the fort coming to my assistance. On examination, I found that besides my head and left hand, I had a slight sword wound on the left knee; and a ball had gone through my trousers a little higher up, slightly grazing the skin, but how and when these happened I know not. The poor pony, directly it was put into a stable, lay down and never rose again. General Sale despatched a party to scour the plain in the hopes of picking up any stragglers, but they only found the bodies [of Brydon’s fellow refugees].” (Lt. Gen. Sir George Lawrence, Reminiscences, 1874.)

Surgeon William Brydon (Shah Shooja’s 6th Hindoostanee Infantry) regarding his escape from Kabul with other refugees of the British garrison, of whom he was ultimately the sole survivor, in 1842: “We had not gone far in the dark before I found myself surrounded [by insurgents], was pulled off my horse, and knocked down by a blow on the head from an Afghan knife, which must have killed me had I not had a Blackwood’s Magazine in my forage cap. As it was, a piece of bone about the size of a wafer was cut from my skull; and I was nearly stunned, but managed to rise on my knee; and seeing that a second blow was coming, I met it with the edge of my sword, and I suppose cut off some of my assailant’s fingers, as his knife fell to the ground. He bolted one way and I the other, minus my horse, cap, and one of my shoes; and I got a severe blow on the shoulder from a fellow who rushed down from the hill and across the road. Soon after, I overtook a Hindoostanee mochee (saddler) of the Shah’s cavalry, who told me he was dying and begged me to take his pony or someone else would. I tried to encourage him; but he fell off, and I found the poor fellow was shot through the chest and dead. I then mounted his pony, and shortly came in sight of the village of Futtehabad. The villagers fired on us, and cavalry charged among us. One fellow cut at me, which I guarded, and he then cut down poor [Lieutenant] Bird; and it became a case of utter rout.

“I proceeded alone for a short distance, unmolested; then I saw a party of about twenty men drawn up in my road, who when I came near, began picking up large stones, with which the plain abounded; so I with difficulty put my pony into a gallop, and taking the bridle in my teeth, cut right and left with my sword as I went through them. They could not reach me with their knives, and I was only hit by one or two stones. A little further on I was met by another similar party, who I tried to pass as I did the former, but was obliged to prick the poor pony with the point of my sword before I could get him into a gallop. Of this party, one man on a mound over the road had a gun, which he fired close down upon me; and a large stone broke my sword, leaving about six inches in the handle. But I got clear of them, and then found that the shot had hit the poor pony, wounding him in the loins; and he could now hardly carry me. But I moved on very slowly and saw some fine horsemen, dressed in red. Supposing they were some of our irregular cavalry, I made towards them, but found they were Afghans. So I tried to get away, but my pony could hardly move; and they sent one of their party after me, who made a cut at me which I, guarding with the bit of my sword, it fell from the hilt. He passed me, but turned and rode at me again. This time, just as he was striking, I threw the handle of the sword at his head, in swerving to avoid which he only cut me over the back of the left hand. Feeling it disabled, I stretched down the right to pick up the bridle. I suppose my foe thought it was for a pistol, for he turned at once and made off as quick as he could.

“I then felt for the pistol I had put in my pocket, but it was gone; and I was unarmed, wounded, and on a poor animal I feared could not carry me to [the British outpost at] Jellalabad, though it was now in sight. Suddenly all energy seemed to forsake me; I became nervous and frightened at shadows; and I really think I should have fallen from my saddle but for the peak of it, and some of our people from the fort coming to my assistance. On examination, I found that besides my head and left hand, I had a slight sword wound on the left knee; and a ball had gone through my trousers a little higher up, slightly grazing the skin, but how and when these happened I know not. The poor pony, directly it was put into a stable, lay down and never rose again. General Sale despatched a party to scour the plain in the hopes of picking up any stragglers, but they only found the bodies [of Brydon’s fellow refugees].” (Lt. Gen.

The front of battle was a chain of single combats, where no quarter was given; sepoys and Europeans and Beloochees alike performed astonishing feats of personal daring and prowess as well as ferocity. Lieutenant McMurdo of the General’s staff, a young man of an intrepid temper, rode down upon the Beloochees. His horse was killed; yet he rose instantly, and meeting one of the greatest and most warlike of the [Beloochee] chiefs, slew him hand to hand in the midst of his tribe. Then, while engaged with several in front, one came behind and struck fiercely; but a sergeant of the 22nd [Foot] killed this enemy so instantly that his blow fell harmless.

Three or four had fallen beneath his tempestuous hand when a Beloochee, crouching, as their custom is, beneath a shield, suddenly stepped up on the bridle hand and with a single stroke brought the horse down dead. FitzGerald’s leg was entangled by the fall, and twice did the elated Beloochee champion drive his keen blade at the prostrate warrior. Each time, the blow was parried; and then, clearing himself from the dead horse, the strong man rose. The Beloochee, warned by the herculean form and countenance, instantly cast his broad shield over his head, which was likewise defended with a thickly rolled turban of many folds; but FitzGerald’s sword in its descent went sheer through shield and turban and skull, down to the teeth! Major Jackson, of the 12th [Bombay Infantry], followed the heroic example.

So impetuous was the onset of these determined warriors, and so energetically and effectually did Havelock and his troopers ply their swords, that the bank was swept in a few minutes of all its occupants. Not contented with having driven the enemy from this position, Havelock instantly resolved to exceed the limits of his mission and renew the offensive, contrary to the real wishes of the commander in chief [Lord Gough], by continuing the charge on the discomfited enemy and driving them back across the river. Yielding to his insatiable love of glory, he brandished his sword above his head and dashed furiously down the steep declivity [of the river bank] into the tract of sand [where the Sikhs had been driven]. Always in advance, Havelock suddenly disappeared; and the latest glimpse of that fiery soldier disclosed him in the midst of the enemy, his left arm half-severed from his body, and dealing frantic blows with his sword, so soon doomed to drop from his trusty right hand. His last words were ‘Follow me!’ Some days after the action, a mutilated corpse was discovered to be that of this daring but ill-fated sabreur.",Asia

Of course, the poor fellows never returned to exult in the number of Feringhees [Europeans] sent by their good tulwars to the Hades of the Khalsa [Sikh nation]. I had to check the career of one of them myself, a fine powerful-looking chief. He rode single-handed to meet the advance of our regiment. Colonel White [commander of the 1st Brigade of the Cavalry Division of the Army of the Punjab, headed by the 3rd Dragoons] ordered the halt to be sounded. My horse was considerably in front [of the serrefiles or flankers of the leading squadron], as on all occasions at the charge he would endeavour to get in front. I perceived the chief was riding towards me. I gave ‘Sprightly’ (my horse) his head, and described a circle round the Sikh. We closed. Our horses’ heads were now turned towards the Sikh cavalry. My opponent made furious sweeps at me, the keen edge of his tulwar producing faint notes in alto through the air all round me. But as he persisted in keeping his horse’s head turned towards his own army, I gave Sprightly to understand that he need not take the lead on this occasion, and that I would modestly attend on the Sikh behind his bridle hand; whence, by a well-directed point, the first blood that was shed on the Punjab campaign now flowed and brought to a close the vaunting of the Sikh chief as he fell over the off-shoulder of his horse.” (Ms. copy, priv. coll.)",Asia

As it was, the saddle received the greater might of the blow; the dorsum portion only of the officer got sliced. He never afterwards sat upright in his saddle.” (Ms. copy, priv. coll.)",Asia

While riding quietly along, I heard a noise, and at the same time saw a Sikh rush forward and seize the bridle of my horse; while several others darted from behind some jungle round me and on all sides. The man, a tall powerful soldier, grasped one rein; and at the same moment, I saw him draw back his arm and give full force to the thrust of his spear, which he directed against my chest. Luckily, the glancing of his spear in the starlight, or his seizing the reins, frightened my horse; for he reared a little and pressed backwards. The spear entered the scarlet shell jacket I wore, but the movement of my horse saved me. He drew back his long spear again to despatch me at once, when I drew one of the long dueling pistols officers usually carry in their holsters in front of the saddle. It twisted a little in pulling it out; but I got it out, cocked it, and just at the very instant the spear again passed through my jacket, the large ball from my pistol passed through his brain. He fell under my horse’s feet, and died without a groan. It was just in time, as the man’s spear pierced my coat and drew blood slightly—no more. Another moment, and it would have pierced my heart.

“When the dead man loosened his hold of my bridle, I saw I was quite surrounded on all sides by a dozen resolute, savage, armed troopers. They all rushed on me at once with their drawn swords and spears. At that very second, a matchlock or musket ball passed straight through my forage cap, tearing several parts of the gold grenade. Had my head been half an inch higher, the ball must necessarily have passed through my brain. Another man closed with me, grasping the reins of my horse; and others tried to strike at me with their swords, or pull me from my horse; but his height, rapid movements, and rearing prevented them. I had now drawn my sword, fearful that the aim of my remaining pistol would be useless, from the unmanageable and violent movements of my horse. The man who hung on by the reins made a desperate cut at my head; and while it was actually descending, I thrust at him with my own—a long, sharp-pointed, double-edged sword. I spurred my horse sharply at the time. I aimed at his chest; and my steed giving a tremendous spring forward, the sword pierced his breast with the whole force of the forward plunge of my horse. The straight sword passed through his chest, the hilt striking his breast bone with a dull hollow sound. While drawing the sword, the others had seized my reins and legs, trying to pull me to the ground; and at the same time, I saw a man aiming straight at me with his long matchlock. I spurred my horse violently, and at the same instant felt a sharp stinging pain in my left thigh, and heard the report of his musket. I thought I was severely wounded, from the sharp pain I felt; and as so many had hold of me, I now only gave myself up for lost, as my strength was failing me and I had no means of escape. I had got several blows from their swords, but no wounds, as the movements of my horse prevented their striking me fair. My horse was cut in several places. I now drew my other pistol, took aim at the man holding my right leg, and shot him through the shoulder. He loosened his grasp; and then I got a blow from some coward on my back, he striking at me from behind. His sword struck me with the flat side, not the edge—having turned in his hand, I suppose, in his eagerness to kill me. I received several more blows, but no wounds, and still defended myself with my sword, though I had no hope. Just then, I heard the discharge of several muskets; there was a desperate struggle for a moment; and the Sikhs were quickly overpowered by the strong detachment which I had accompanied to the trenches, and who were most fortunately brought back by the report of firearms. In a few moments, every Sikh was struggling on his back, pinned to the ground by our men’s bayonets.” (“Single Combat With The Sikhs,” Colonial Times, Aug. 28, 1849.)",Asia

It was an awkward situation in truth, and it behooved me to be wary if I wished to escape from it alive. Being to the left of the street, my left was guarded; but my front and right side were open to attack, and two of my enemy immediately bore down on me together. One was a little in front of the other; and as he appeared the more forward and dangerous, I was obliged to pay my most particular attention to him. My sword was longer than his; and in order to keep him from closing in before I was ready for him, I placed myself in position to meet his attack, feinted with my sword, and succeeded in avoiding his guards; while I cut him smartly with the point of my sword twice on his left temple. This I did to judge distance and to prevent his coming nearer till it suited me. He was, however, determined to get at me; for he went off his guard and prepared to strike me with his tulwar. This gave me my opportunity; and before he could strike, I stepped in and cut him with my full force on his bare head, and by so doing broke the blade of my sword. He fell on his side and right knee, but partly recovering, still flourished his tulwar backwards and forwards; and as I was now about to be attacked by my second adversary, and had no weapon left with which to defend myself, I perceived that my only chance was to possess myself of this tulwar. Accordingly, I struck the man again on the head with the remaining portion of my sword, when he at once dropped his tulwar, which I instantly picked up. Then I turned on my other foe; but he was lying on his back, close to my right foot, quite dead, with a bullet wound in his breast. One of my men, seeing the predicament I was in, had evidently fired and shot him just in time to save my life. I confess I was thankful enough to find him dead, as I could have made but a poor hand with my tulwar against a Sikh who understood the weapon perfectly. I understood fencing and singlestick thoroughly, having been taught by the best masters since I was a boy, but the tulwar is used in quite a different manner. The tulwar and the fragment of my own broken sword are in my possession to this day, and I preserve them as mementos of certainly the ‘tightest corner’ that I was ever in. One captain of my regiment had a sword cut through his cap and nearly into his brain, and another cutting off the side of his face and laying it upon his shoulder. Poor man!

The tulwar and the fragment of my own broken sword are in my possession to this day, and I preserve them as mementos of certainly the ‘tightest corner’ that I was ever in. One captain of my regiment had a sword cut through his cap and nearly into his brain, and another cutting off the side of his face and laying it upon his shoulder. Poor man!

Thomas Maunsell regarding his encounters as a lieutenant of the 32nd Foot during the street fighting in Mooltan in 1849: “I rushed forward, but halted at once, as a crowd of Sikh soldiers, advancing at the charge with their heads bare and their tulwars drawn and held aloft, were close upon me. It was an awkward situation in truth, and it behooved me to be wary if I wished to escape from it alive. Being to the left of the street, my left was guarded; but my front and right side were open to attack, and two of my enemy immediately bore down on me together. One was a little in front of the other; and as he appeared the more forward and dangerous, I was obliged to pay my most particular attention to him. My sword was longer than his; and in order to keep him from closing in before I was ready for him, I placed myself in position to meet his attack, feinted with my sword, and succeeded in avoiding his guards; while I cut him smartly with the point of my sword twice on his left temple. This I did to judge distance and to prevent his coming nearer till it suited me. He was, however, determined to get at me; for he went off his guard and prepared to strike me with his tulwar. This gave me my opportunity; and before he could strike, I stepped in and cut him with my full force on his bare head, and by so doing broke the blade of my sword. He fell on his side and right knee, but partly recovering, still flourished his tulwar backwards and forwards; and as I was now about to be attacked by my second adversary, and had no weapon left with which to defend myself, I perceived that my only chance was to possess myself of this tulwar. Accordingly, I struck the man again on the head with the remaining portion of my sword, when he at once dropped his tulwar, which I instantly picked up. Then I turned on my other foe; but he was lying on his back, close to my right foot, quite dead, with a bullet wound in his breast. One of my men, seeing the predicament I was in, had evidently fired and shot him just in time to save my life.

Anyway, the challenge was accepted; and the four rode at each other, the Pathans on their ponies, their tulwars waving in circles round their heads, their loose garments flowing. The Bengalees sat erect on their big horses, their swords held ready to deliver the ‘point’, a stroke no irregular cavalryman comprehends, as he does not in his sword exercise learn to parry the thrust. [Until Asians encountered Europeans and European-trained Asians, there were few if any thrusts to parry! It was mostly guard and cut.] For a moment, all eyes were on the four combatants. The thrust was delivered; but instead of piercing the bodies of the Pathans, it passed over them; for they threw themselves back on their ponies, their heads on the crupper, their feet by the ponies’ ears, and in that position swept off the heads of the Bengal Cavalry men. Instantly the ponies wheeled round, the men straightened themselves in their saddles, and they passed away from our vision. Then Nicholson came into view; he too was going to kill his man. The scene was a brief one; the mutineer thrust at the great swordsman, who parried the thrust, and with apparently the same motion, clove his assailant’s head in two.

The ressaldar, a Wulytee or Afghan, went forward to meet his rival of the rebel host. Asiatics never thrust with their swords; but after a few rapid cuts and guards, the head of the mutineer regular was swept from his body; and the Guide, seizing the bridle of the dead man’s horse, a powerful stud-bred, plundered by its late owner from Government, and springing into the saddle, turned to his men, as he lifted his dripping sword over his head, and exclaimed, ‘By the blessing of the Prophet, may we all get mounted in a similar manner!’” (Service and Adventure With the Khakee Ressalah, 1858.)",Asia

I was slightly wounded in two places—one a sword cut across my chin and lower part of my cheek, and the other across my left hip, a little below the bone. The way I got them was this: I was skirmishing along with a number of men, when I was rather astonished to find we were quite outnumbered; however, there was no help for it now except to fight it out. Immediately, I had the satisfaction of seeing three fellows coming with a rush at me. The first, a great tall fellow, evidently excited to delirium almost by bhang, raised his sword and made a slashing back-handed cut, which, had it taken full effect, must have rolled my head off. However, my usual good luck came to my help; and instead of cutting at my ‘friend’, I had just time to change the cut into a guard. My good cavalry sword stood well, though a deep cut was made in the steel; however, my guard having been hurriedly made, and my opponent a stronger man than myself, my sword was beaten down and my cheek laid open. After the blow, I had my turn and gave my ‘friend’ one across the head, which did not cut him down to the shoulder as I had imagined—the skull being a very tough article. At the same moment, one of our men bayoneted this fellow; and [Captain] Daly cut him down too. As I got my cheek cut, I felt a cut just below my hip. The man who did it was instantly bayoneted, and a moment afterwards a third fellow rushed at me—a rather short little scoundrel. He made a vicious cut at my head too; but, being much taller, I easily guarded it; and as I stepped a little forward after this blow, I had full time to raise myself, arm, and sword to their full stretch.

Tombs’ exploits: “My guns were ridden over before I could get them into action, and I was very nearly polished off—Tombs saving my life by potting a Pandy [mutineer] who was in the act of splitting my skull. I was down on the ground, regularly done up, without a single thing to defend myself with. I have got great kudos for my conduct. This is it—the alarm went; and off I started with my two guns to a position laid down for them, when, to my astonishment, through an opening on my right, only fifty yards off, dashed a body of cavalry. Now I tried to get my guns into action, but only got one unlimbered when they were upon me. I thought that by charging them I might make a commotion and give the gun time to load; so in I went at the front rank, cut down the first fellow, slashed the next across the face as hard as I could lick, when two sowars [troopers] charged me. Both their horses crashed into mine at the same moment, and of course both horse and myself were sent flying. We went down at such a pace that I escaped the cuts made at me, one of them giving my jacket an awful slice just below the left arm; it only, however, cut the jacket.

“Well, I lay quite snug until all the beggars had passed over me, and then got up and looked about for my sword. I found it full ten yards off. I had hardly got hold of it when three fellows returned—two on horseback. The first I wounded [with a pistol shot] and dropped him from his horse; the second charged me with a lance. I put it aside, and caught him an awful gash on the head and face. I thought I had killed him; apparently he must have clung to his horse, for he disappeared. The wounded man then came up, but got his skull split. Then came on the third man—a young, active fellow. I found myself getting very weak from want of breath, the fall from my horse having pumped me considerably; and my cloak somehow or other had got tightly fixed round my throat, and was kindly choking me. I went, however, at the fellow and cut him on the shoulder; but some cloth on it apparently turned the blow. He managed to seize the hilt of my sword and twisted it out of my hand; and then we had a hand-to-hand fight, I punching his head with my fists and he trying to cut me, but I was too close to him. Somehow or other I fell; and then was the time, fortunately for me, that Tombs came up and shot the fellow. I was so choked by my cloak that move I could not until I got it loosened.

“By the bye, I forgot to say I fired at this chap twice, but the pistol snapped [misfired]; and I was so enraged I drove [threw it] at the fellow’s head—missing him, however. Then, when I got up, Tombs was so eager to get up to a mound near us [to see if any of his artillerymen were wounded] that I only picked up my sword and followed him. After being there some time, we came down again to look after the unlimbered gun which was left behind. When we got down, I saw the very man Tombs had saved me from, moving off with my pistol—the brute had only been wounded, and shammed dead. I told Tombs, and we went at him. After a little slashing and guarding on both sides, I rushed in at him and thrust. He cleverly jumped aside and cut me on the head, knocking me down—not, however, stunning me; for I warded his next cut when down. Tombs, following him up, made him a pass; and up I jumped and had a slash at him, cutting him on the left wrist, nearly severing it. This made him turn round, and then Tombs ran him through. He very nearly knocked over Tombs; for he cut through his cap and pugrie [turban], but fortunately did not even cut the skin.

“I fancy I am indebted again to Tombs for my life; for although I might have got up again and fought, still I was bleeding like a pig and of course would have had a bad chance. One thing, however—if Tombs had not been there the second time, I should have fought more carefully. It was the wish to polish off the fellow before Tombs could get up to him that made me rush at him in the way I did. I wanted awfully to ‘bone’ [pick up] the swords of the men I killed as trophies, but I was getting very faint and had to come into my tent as fast as I could; and before I got the wound bound up, the swords had been looted off. I had lost an awful lot of blood, as two veins were cut through; but I fancy it did me good, keeping off inflammation. The wound was a beautiful one, just as if it had been done by a razor. It was four inches long and down to the skull, a line being left on it, so I had a narrow escape.” (Charles Ball, History of the Indian Mutiny, 1858; Narrative of the Indian Revolt, 1858.)",Asia

I went, however, at the fellow and cut him on the shoulder; but some cloth on it apparently turned the blow. He managed to seize the hilt of my sword and twisted it out of my hand; and then we had a hand-to-hand fight, I punching his head with my fists and he trying to cut me, but I was too close to him. Somehow or other I fell; and then was the time, fortunately for me, that Tombs came up and shot the fellow. I was so choked by my cloak that move I could not until I got it loosened.

“By the bye, I forgot to say I fired at this chap twice, but the pistol snapped [misfired]; and I was so enraged I drove [threw it] at the fellow’s head—missing him, however. Then, when I got up, Tombs was so eager to get up to a mound near us [to see if any of his artillerymen were wounded] that I only picked up my sword and followed him. After being there some time, we came down again to look after the unlimbered gun which was left behind. When we got down, I saw the very man Tombs had saved me from, moving off with my pistol—the brute had only been wounded, and shammed dead. I told Tombs, and we went at him. After a little slashing and guarding on both sides, I rushed in at him and thrust. He cleverly jumped aside and cut me on the head, knocking me down—not, however, stunning me; for I warded his next cut when down. Tombs, following him up, made him a pass; and up I jumped and had a slash at him, cutting him on the left wrist, nearly severing it. This made him turn round, and then Tombs ran him through. He very nearly knocked over Tombs; for he cut through his cap and pugrie [turban], but fortunately did not even cut the skin.

“I fancy I am indebted again to Tombs for my life; for although I might have got up again and fought, still I was bleeding like a pig and of course would have had a bad chance. One thing, however—if Tombs had not been there the second time, I should have fought more carefully. It was the wish to polish off the fellow before Tombs could get up to him that made me rush at him in the way I did. I wanted awfully to ‘bone’ [pick up] the swords of the men I killed as trophies, but I was getting very faint and had to come into my tent as fast as I could; and before I got the wound bound up, the swords had been looted off. I had lost an awful lot of blood, as two veins were cut through; but I fancy it did me good, keeping off inflammation. The wound was a beautiful one, just as if it had been done by a razor. It was four inches long and down to the skull, a line being left on it, so I had a narrow escape.” (Charles Ball, History of the Indian Mutiny, 1858; Narrative of the Indian Revolt, 1858.)",Asia
778,400,Delhi,1857.0,Open Hand,Lt. Hills,Strike,Head,Ineffective,Ineffective,Foot,Sword taking,,,BSF 159,"Here is Lt. Hills’ account of his and Maj. Tombs’ exploits: “My guns were ridden over before I could get them into action, and I was very nearly polished off—Tombs saving my life by potting a Pandy [mutineer] who was in the act of splitting my skull. I was down on the ground, regularly done up, without a single thing to defend myself with. I have got great kudos for my conduct. This is it—the alarm went; and off I started with my two guns to a position laid down for them, when, to my astonishment, through an opening on my right, only fifty yards off, dashed a body of cavalry. Now I tried to get my guns into action, but only got one unlimbered when they were upon me. I thought that by charging them I might make a commotion and give the gun time to load; so in I went at the front rank, cut down the first fellow, slashed the next across the face as hard as I could lick, when two sowars [troopers] charged me. Both their horses crashed into mine at the same moment, and of course both horse and myself were sent flying. We went down at such a pace that I escaped the cuts made at me, one of them giving my jacket an awful slice just below the left arm; it only, however, cut the jacket.

“Well, I lay quite snug until all the beggars had passed over me, and then got up and looked about for my sword. I found it full ten yards off. I had hardly got hold of it when three fellows returned—two on horseback. The first I wounded [with a pistol shot] and dropped him from his horse; the second charged me with a lance. I put it aside, and caught him an awful gash on the head and face. I thought I had killed him; apparently he must have clung to his horse, for he disappeared. The wounded man then came up, but got his skull split. Then came on the third man—a young, active fellow. I found myself getting very weak from want of breath, the fall from my horse having pumped me considerably; and my cloak somehow or other had got tightly fixed round my throat, and was kindly choking me.

Fosbery of the Bengal Staff Corps: “An officer, who especially prided himself on his pistol shooting, was attacked by a stalwart mutineer armed with a heavy sword. The officer, unfortunately for himself, carried a Colt’s Navy pistol, which was of small calibre and fired a sharp-pointed picket [or conical] bullet of sixty to the pound [60 gauge] and a heavy charge of powder, its range being at least 600 yards. This he proceeded to empty into the sepoy as he advanced; but, having done so, he waited just one second too long to see the effect of his shooting, and was cloven to the teeth by his antagonist, who then dropped down and died beside him. My informant, who witnessed the affair, told me that five out of the six bullets had struck the sepoy close together in the chest, and had all passed through him and out at his back.” (“On Pistols,” Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, 1896.)",Asia

William Hodson in 1857: “We took Khurkowdah by surprise, and Hodson immediately placed men over the gates and we went in. Shot one scoundrel instanter, cut down another, and took a ressaldar (native officer) and some sowars (troopers) prisoners, and came to a house occupied by some more, who would not let us in at all. At last we rushed in and found the rascals had taken to the upper storey, and still kept us at bay. There was only one door and a kirkee (window). I shoved in my head through the door, with a [double-barreled] pistol in my hand, and got a clip over my turban for my pains. My pistol missed fire at the man’s breast (you must send me a revolver); so I got out of that as fast as I could, and then tried the kirkee with the other barrel, and very nearly got another cut. We tried every means to get in, but could not; so we fired the house, and out they rushed—running amuck among us. The first fellow went at Hugh [Charles’ brother and fellow lieutenant], who wounded him, but somehow or other he slipped and fell on his back. I saw him fall, and thinking he was hurt, rushed to the rescue. A Guide got a chop at the fellow, and I gave him such a swinging backhander that he fell dead. I then went at another fellow rushing by my left, and sent my sword through him, like butter, and bagged him. I then looked round and saw a sword come crash on the shoulders of a poor little boy [a young Guide]. Oh, such a cut! and up went the sword again; and the next moment the boy would have been in eternity, but I ran forward and covered him with my sword and saved him. During this it was over with seven men. [Captain] Ward had shot one with his revolver, [Gough had sabred two,] and the other four were cut down at once. Hugh I found was all right, only a slight cut just above the wrist. Having polished off these fellows, we held an impromptu court martial on those we had taken and shot them all. Next day we continued our march and got to Rohtuk, where some sowars and the people of the town turned out against us, but fled like sheep before the Guides, led by Hugh and myself; but we managed to cut up thirteen of them.

“Next morning we were surprised to find a party of sowars galloping down upon us, but we charged and they bolted. I got a-cropper over a hedge and ditch in which my horse had fallen, but picked myself up and continued the pursuit, and soon caught up a couple of sowars. One fellow fired at me, but missed me, and off they both bolted. I put my spurs into Cavalier’s sides and quickly overtook the rearmost man, and equally quickly polished him off. I then went after the other and caught him up, when he had the impertinence to try and frighten me by presenting his matchlock at me; but this was too good, seeing that he had just fired it at me. I rode at him and gave him a cut on the neck, which he did not like at all; and he struck me over the shoulders with his matchlock barrel, which I returned by a second cut, which dropped my fine fellow from his saddle; but he was not done for yet, and I turned my horse and rode at him. He came at me in a furious rage and made a terrific cut at my leg, which I guarded, and as cool as a cucumber and in a most scientific manner, returned ‘point one’. And now can you fancy the trick he played me? He actually seized my sword in his hand, and before I could get it out [of his hand], cut me over the head; but, as that was ensconced in a basket helmet enveloped in a most voluminous Guide pugree (turban), the blow did not take effect. I was not going to give him another chance, and drove my horse right at him and sent my sword into him as far as I could. The consequence was, he had not room for a cut at me, but hit and wounded my gallant little horse on the cheek. One of the Guides then came up and he was soon disposed of, but fighting to the last. I have the fellow’s mare in my possession. Hugh led the other troop of the Guides and shot two fellows with his revolver, but his mare got a bullet in her chest in the charge.

Next day we continued our march and got to Rohtuk, where some sowars and the people of the town turned out against us, but fled like sheep before the Guides, led by Hugh and myself; but we managed to cut up thirteen of them.

“Next morning we were surprised to find a party of sowars galloping down upon us, but we charged and they bolted. I got a-cropper over a hedge and ditch in which my horse had fallen, but picked myself up and continued the pursuit, and soon caught up a couple of sowars. One fellow fired at me, but missed me, and off they both bolted. I put my spurs into Cavalier’s sides and quickly overtook the rearmost man, and equally quickly polished him off. I then went after the other and caught him up, when he had the impertinence to try and frighten me by presenting his matchlock at me; but this was too good, seeing that he had just fired it at me. I rode at him and gave him a cut on the neck, which he did not like at all; and he struck me over the shoulders with his matchlock barrel, which I returned by a second cut, which dropped my fine fellow from his saddle; but he was not done for yet, and I turned my horse and rode at him. He came at me in a furious rage and made a terrific cut at my leg, which I guarded, and as cool as a cucumber and in a most scientific manner, returned ‘point one’. And now can you fancy the trick he played me? He actually seized my sword in his hand, and before I could get it out [of his hand], cut me over the head; but, as that was ensconced in a basket helmet enveloped in a most voluminous Guide pugree (turban), the blow did not take effect. I was not going to give him another chance, and drove my horse right at him and sent my sword into him as far as I could.

I then went at another fellow rushing by my left, and sent my sword through him, like butter, and bagged him. I then looked round and saw a sword come crash on the shoulders of a poor little boy [a young Guide]. Oh, such a cut! and up went the sword again; and the next moment the boy would have been in eternity, but I ran forward and covered him with my sword and saved him.

Jones, of the 9th Lancers, at the battle of Agra in 1857: “Two squadrons of the enemy’s cavalry began to advance, and it became necessary for the troop of the 9th Lancers [guarding two advanced artillery guns] to advance to meet the attack. The troop numbered only 23, with two officers (both in front); and as soon as formed, it trotted to meet the leading squadron of the enemy, which greatly outflanked such a weak troop. The senior officer, Captain French, was almost immediately hit by a stray shot. His horse, turning to the left, passed clear of the front of the troop; and then the remaining officer (Lieutenant Jones) gave the word ‘Gallop’. No sooner had he done so, however, than the enemy’s squadron halted and began firing with carbines, the leader taking a deliberate aim at Jones, who immediately rode at him. He came on two or three horses’ lengths in front, at a little to the left of his small troop, and the enemy’s squadron leader fired when the horses nearly touched each other. The carbine bullet passed through Lieutenant Jones’s bridle arm, between the elbow and the shoulder, numbing the power of his bridle hand and leading him instinctively to seize the reins with his sword hand. In that defenceless position, he passed into the ranks of the enemy, immediately behind the squadron leader who had shot him. He then received a sword cut through his left eye; and his horse, rearing up, deposited him on his feet on the ground. One man of his troop, following close upon his officer, had put his lance through the squadron leader who had shot him; and he afterwards endeavoured to assist his officer, but was overpowered and driven away. For his good conduct on this occasion, this man, Private Freeman, received the Victoria Cross.

“Lieutenant Jones, thus left to himself, was soon surrounded by such of the enemy as had not been ridden down by his troop. These numbered at first, perhaps, twenty; and they sought to despatch the wounded officer, while his own men had ridden on in pursuit of their comrades. The very number of his assailants seems to have been the saving of my friend; for in their eagerness to get a cut at the Sahib, they got into one another’s way; and none seem to have thought of using the point of their swords or [their] firearms. While able to stand up, many cuts aimed at his head were guarded, or partially guarded, by his sword, as eight slight scalp wounds amply testified. Sinking at last from loss of blood, the cripple drew his revolver, and while lying on his side, discharged the first barrel [i.e., chamber] into the breast of a man whose horse stood nearly over him while the rider raised his sword for a last cut. By this time, the mutineers still about him were very few, as those who made the first rush on seeing a wounded Sahib had mostly slipped away, to look after their own retreat from what they knew was a lost battle. A few hours later, this desperately wounded man was taken in a doolie [covered litter] to the hospital in Agra Fort and tended with such extreme care by certain kind-hearted ladies, inspired by Miss Nightingale’s Crimean example, that ere two months were over he was on his way to England, with nearly all his twenty-three wounds fast healing.” (J. H. Stocqueler, A Familiar History of the British Army, 1871.)

“Jones was a fearful object; his head and face were swollen up, one of his eyes was cut out, and a piece of his skull severed from his head, besides numerous wounds all over his body. Nevertheless, he bore up well and ultimately entirely recovered—with the exception, of course, of his eyesight.” (Gen. Sir Hope Grant, Incidents in the Sepoy War, 1873.)

Bvt. Maj. O. H. S. G. Anson, 9th Lancers: “I had a look at poor young Jones, who is, indeed, desperately wounded, having been shot in both arms, cut about both eyes, having further been cut down the back and across the stomach, and received a dangerous cut on the back of his head. In spite of all, he retains his senses and is doing as well as a man can do in his circumstances. There is, I hear, a good chance of his ultimate recovery, though he lost nearly every drop of blood in his body.” (With H.M. 9th Lancers During the Indian Mutiny, 1896.)

E. Katherine Bates, a British traveler in India: “A brother officer had told me that he was standing close by Colonel Jones when, as a young officer, the latter attended the levée to receive his Victoria Cross, and that the Queen was so much agitated by his appearance that she could hardly pin it on. Also, that this brother officer heard her whisper to her husband: ‘My God, Albert! look at that poor boy! He has been cut to pieces!’” (Seen and Unseen, 1907.)

Here is Jones’ account of his misadventure: “I saw a strong squadron coming down upon the guns, when I gave the word ‘Gallop’. The opposing squadron halted, and I saw another squadron en échelon behind it. As I noticed the squadron leader aiming his carbine at me, I rode at him, and had the hilt of my sword on my hip, ready to pass him ‘third point’, when he fired; and feeling my bridle arm useless, I took the reins in my sword hand and pushed my horse into the rank behind him, when my horse reared straight up and slipped me over his tail. I lighted on my feet, with the stirrup come away from the body of the plain saddle I was riding on. I distinctly remember kicking the stirrup off my foot on the ground, and then keeping a ‘7th guard’ to my head with my sword. The force of many cuts was broken; and those horsemen were looking about them in great anxiety, all the time they were hustling each other to get a cut at me. One man [Pvt. John Freeman] on the left of my troop tried to get at me, but was driven off by the crowd; and when I sank on my side from loss of blood, I pulled out my revolver [a Colt] and shot a man with the first barrel, afterwards cocking it and firing one or two more times. All that time, my enemies were dropping off; and at last there were only two left, who were bent upon taking my sword, which hung by the leather sword knot from my wrist; and when I opened my eyes after feeling cuts on my right elbow, I knew they were trying to cut the knot; then I shook it off my hand, and neither heard nor felt any more enemies. I was carried in a doolie into the Moti Musjed [hospital], very kindly nursed by two ladies, and in two months’ time was well enough to travel home.” (C. H.

Katherine Bates, a British traveler in India: “A brother officer had told me that he was standing close by Colonel Jones when, as a young officer, the latter attended the levée to receive his Victoria Cross, and that the Queen was so much agitated by his appearance that she could hardly pin it on. Also, that this brother officer heard her whisper to her husband: ‘My God, Albert! look at that poor boy! He has been cut to pieces!’” (Seen and Unseen, 1907.)

Here is Jones’ account of his misadventure: “I saw a strong squadron coming down upon the guns, when I gave the word ‘Gallop’. The opposing squadron halted, and I saw another squadron en échelon behind it. As I noticed the squadron leader aiming his carbine at me, I rode at him, and had the hilt of my sword on my hip, ready to pass him ‘third point’, when he fired; and feeling my bridle arm useless, I took the reins in my sword hand and pushed my horse into the rank behind him, when my horse reared straight up and slipped me over his tail. I lighted on my feet, with the stirrup come away from the body of the plain saddle I was riding on. I distinctly remember kicking the stirrup off my foot on the ground, and then keeping a ‘7th guard’ to my head with my sword. The force of many cuts was broken; and those horsemen were looking about them in great anxiety, all the time they were hustling each other to get a cut at me. One man [Pvt. John Freeman] on the left of my troop tried to get at me, but was driven off by the crowd; and when I sank on my side from loss of blood, I pulled out my revolver [a Colt] and shot a man with the first barrel, afterwards cocking it and firing one or two more times. All that time, my enemies were dropping off; and at last there were only two left, who were bent upon taking my sword, which hung by the leather sword knot from my wrist; and when I opened my eyes after feeling cuts on my right elbow, I knew they were trying to cut the knot; then I shook it off my hand, and neither heard nor felt any more enemies. I was carried in a doolie into the Moti Musjed [hospital], very kindly nursed by two ladies, and in two months’ time was well enough to travel home.” (C. H.

Jones, of the 9th Lancers, at the battle of Agra in 1857: “Two squadrons of the enemy’s cavalry began to advance, and it became necessary for the troop of the 9th Lancers [guarding two advanced artillery guns] to advance to meet the attack. The troop numbered only 23, with two officers (both in front); and as soon as formed, it trotted to meet the leading squadron of the enemy, which greatly outflanked such a weak troop. The senior officer, Captain French, was almost immediately hit by a stray shot. His horse, turning to the left, passed clear of the front of the troop; and then the remaining officer (Lieutenant Jones) gave the word ‘Gallop’. No sooner had he done so, however, than the enemy’s squadron halted and began firing with carbines, the leader taking a deliberate aim at Jones, who immediately rode at him. He came on two or three horses’ lengths in front, at a little to the left of his small troop, and the enemy’s squadron leader fired when the horses nearly touched each other. The carbine bullet passed through Lieutenant Jones’s bridle arm, between the elbow and the shoulder, numbing the power of his bridle hand and leading him instinctively to seize the reins with his sword hand. In that defenceless position, he passed into the ranks of the enemy, immediately behind the squadron leader who had shot him. He then received a sword cut through his left eye; and his horse, rearing up, deposited him on his feet on the ground. One man of his troop, following close upon his officer, had put his lance through the squadron leader who had shot him; and he afterwards endeavoured to assist his officer, but was overpowered and driven away. For his good conduct on this occasion, this man, Private Freeman, received the Victoria Cross.

“Lieutenant Jones, thus left to himself, was soon surrounded by such of the enemy as had not been ridden down by his troop. These numbered at first, perhaps, twenty; and they sought to despatch the wounded officer, while his own men had ridden on in pursuit of their comrades. The very number of his assailants seems to have been the saving of my friend; for in their eagerness to get a cut at the Sahib, they got into one another’s way; and none seem to have thought of using the point of their swords or [their] firearms. While able to stand up, many cuts aimed at his head were guarded, or partially guarded, by his sword, as eight slight scalp wounds amply testified. Sinking at last from loss of blood, the cripple drew his revolver, and while lying on his side, discharged the first barrel [i.e., chamber] into the breast of a man whose horse stood nearly over him while the rider raised his sword for a last cut. By this time, the mutineers still about him were very few, as those who made the first rush on seeing a wounded Sahib had mostly slipped away, to look after their own retreat from what they knew was a lost battle. A few hours later, this desperately wounded man was taken in a doolie [covered litter] to the hospital in Agra Fort and tended with such extreme care by certain kind-hearted ladies, inspired by Miss Nightingale’s Crimean example, that ere two months were over he was on his way to England, with nearly all his twenty-three wounds fast healing.” (J. H. Stocqueler, A Familiar History of the British Army, 1871.)

“Jones was a fearful object; his head and face were swollen up, one of his eyes was cut out, and a piece of his skull severed from his head, besides numerous wounds all over his body. Nevertheless, he bore up well and ultimately entirely recovered—with the exception, of course, of his eyesight.” (Gen. Sir Hope Grant, Incidents in the Sepoy War, 1873.)

Anson, 9th Lancers: “I had a look at poor young Jones, who is, indeed, desperately wounded, having been shot in both arms, cut about both eyes, having further been cut down the back and across the stomach, and received a dangerous cut on the back of his head.

There is, I hear, a good chance of his ultimate recovery, though he lost nearly every drop of blood in his body.” (With H.M. 9th Lancers During the Indian Mutiny, 1896.)

E. Katherine Bates, a British traveler in India: “A brother officer had told me that he was standing close by Colonel Jones when, as a young officer, the latter attended the levée to receive his Victoria Cross, and that the Queen was so much agitated by his appearance that she could hardly pin it on. Also, that this brother officer heard her whisper to her husband: ‘My God, Albert! look at that poor boy! He has been cut to pieces!’” (Seen and Unseen, 1907.)

Here is Jones’ account of his misadventure: “I saw a strong squadron coming down upon the guns, when I gave the word ‘Gallop’. The opposing squadron halted, and I saw another squadron en échelon behind it. As I noticed the squadron leader aiming his carbine at me, I rode at him, and had the hilt of my sword on my hip, ready to pass him ‘third point’, when he fired; and feeling my bridle arm useless, I took the reins in my sword hand and pushed my horse into the rank behind him, when my horse reared straight up and slipped me over his tail. I lighted on my feet, with the stirrup come away from the body of the plain saddle I was riding on. I distinctly remember kicking the stirrup off my foot on the ground, and then keeping a ‘7th guard’ to my head with my sword. The force of many cuts was broken; and those horsemen were looking about them in great anxiety, all the time they were hustling each other to get a cut at me. One man [Pvt. John Freeman] on the left of my troop tried to get at me, but was driven off by the crowd; and when I sank on my side from loss of blood, I pulled out my revolver [a Colt] and shot a man with the first barrel, afterwards cocking it and firing one or two more times. All that time, my enemies were dropping off; and at last there were only two left, who were bent upon taking my sword, which hung by the leather sword knot from my wrist; and when I opened my eyes after feeling cuts on my right elbow, I knew they were trying to cut the knot; then I shook it off my hand, and neither heard nor felt any more enemies. I was carried in a doolie into the Moti Musjed [hospital], very kindly nursed by two ladies, and in two months’ time was well enough to travel home.” (C. H.

Jones, of the 9th Lancers, at the battle of Agra in 1857: “Two squadrons of the enemy’s cavalry began to advance, and it became necessary for the troop of the 9th Lancers [guarding two advanced artillery guns] to advance to meet the attack. The troop numbered only 23, with two officers (both in front); and as soon as formed, it trotted to meet the leading squadron of the enemy, which greatly outflanked such a weak troop. The senior officer, Captain French, was almost immediately hit by a stray shot. His horse, turning to the left, passed clear of the front of the troop; and then the remaining officer (Lieutenant Jones) gave the word ‘Gallop’. No sooner had he done so, however, than the enemy’s squadron halted and began firing with carbines, the leader taking a deliberate aim at Jones, who immediately rode at him. He came on two or three horses’ lengths in front, at a little to the left of his small troop, and the enemy’s squadron leader fired when the horses nearly touched each other. The carbine bullet passed through Lieutenant Jones’s bridle arm, between the elbow and the shoulder, numbing the power of his bridle hand and leading him instinctively to seize the reins with his sword hand. In that defenceless position, he passed into the ranks of the enemy, immediately behind the squadron leader who had shot him. He then received a sword cut through his left eye; and his horse, rearing up, deposited him on his feet on the ground. One man of his troop, following close upon his officer, had put his lance through the squadron leader who had shot him; and he afterwards endeavoured to assist his officer, but was overpowered and driven away. For his good conduct on this occasion, this man, Private Freeman, received the Victoria Cross.

“Lieutenant Jones, thus left to himself, was soon surrounded by such of the enemy as had not been ridden down by his troop. These numbered at first, perhaps, twenty; and they sought to despatch the wounded officer, while his own men had ridden on in pursuit of their comrades. The very number of his assailants seems to have been the saving of my friend; for in their eagerness to get a cut at the Sahib, they got into one another’s way; and none seem to have thought of using the point of their swords or [their] firearms. While able to stand up, many cuts aimed at his head were guarded, or partially guarded, by his sword, as eight slight scalp wounds amply testified. Sinking at last from loss of blood, the cripple drew his revolver, and while lying on his side, discharged the first barrel [i.e., chamber] into the breast of a man whose horse stood nearly over him while the rider raised his sword for a last cut. By this time, the mutineers still about him were very few, as those who made the first rush on seeing a wounded Sahib had mostly slipped away, to look after their own retreat from what they knew was a lost battle. A few hours later, this desperately wounded man was taken in a doolie [covered litter] to the hospital in Agra Fort and tended with such extreme care by certain kind-hearted ladies, inspired by Miss Nightingale’s Crimean example, that ere two months were over he was on his way to England, with nearly all his twenty-three wounds fast healing.” (J. H. Stocqueler, A Familiar History of the British Army, 1871.)

“Jones was a fearful object; his head and face were swollen up, one of his eyes was cut out, and a piece of his skull severed from his head, besides numerous wounds all over his body. Nevertheless, he bore up well and ultimately entirely recovered—with the exception, of course, of his eyesight.” (Gen. Sir Hope Grant, Incidents in the Sepoy War, 1873.)

Gordon-Alexander regarding a single combat that occurred during the British advance on Lucknow in 1857, when he was a lieutenant in the 93rd Highlanders: “During the day [November 15th], the only excitement our picket had was a single combat between one of the Bengal Artillery gunners and a Ghazi [religious warrior]. The gunner wandered down about half past six or seven in the morning, fortunately with his sword on, towards the edge of the wood above which [on a knoll] we were posted. The grass was very high; and he did not observe a native, armed only with a tulwar, and with a blanket thrown over one shoulder, approach him stealthily from the wood. Several of the officers, including myself, observed the man emerge from the wood and shouted to the gunner to ‘Look out’. The gunner, a big Irishman, drew his sword and waited for the Ghazi to advance, which he did, flourishing his tulwar over his head with one hand and swinging his blanket round and round with the other. Mr. Traill [Lt. G. B. Traill, Bengal Horse Artillery] said that the gunner would be quite a match for the Ghazi, so it was agreed that they should be allowed to fight it out. 

“The wary old gunner never attempted at first to strike or thrust, but contented himself with parrying the blows aimed at him by the Ghazi, at the same time dodging the blanket. After fully ten minutes of this kind of fencing, the gunner found his opportunity, and with a sharp turn of the wrist, drove his sword up to the hilt through his opponent’s body. The audience now consisted of all the men of our picket, who applauded this coup and cheered the artilleryman. The native, however, to our surprise, showed no signs of dropping, but still continued to dance round our man. Then, one of the vedettes of the ‘Dumpies’ [Military Train Cavalry, so called because they were generally short and stout] rode up and endeavoured to get his untrained horse alongside of the Ghazi, although we shouted to him to leave them to fight it out. I don’t think he could have heard us; for although a bad rider, as all the ‘Dumpies’ were, he persevered in his efforts to make his horse face the Ghazi’s blanket, and managed at last to get one blow at the Ghazi’s head, which knocked the already mortally wounded man down, all of us on the hill shouting ‘Fair play!’

“The gunner, finding his adversary could not rise again, owing to the fearful wound he had himself dealt him—a wound in the abdomen which had, in fact, disemboweled the man—possessed himself of the tulwar as a trophy, and leaving him lying there, rejoined us on the knoll. That evening, about five o’clock, another gunner had gone down to look at the body of the Ghazi, and to our astonishment came back and reported that the man was alive and quite sensible. Traill, [Captain] Burroughs, and I went down to see him; and although he had lain there in a hot sun in that awful condition all day, he answered—in a whisper, to be sure—a number of questions Traill put to him in Hindustani, telling us, among other things, that he had come out to kill a Feringi [European] and so win Paradise. When we returned to the picket, Traill ordered the gunner with whom he had fought to go down and put a bullet through his head, and so put him out of pain. I do not think any European could possibly have lived thus for nearly ten hours actually disemboweled; certainly he could not have retained his senses; but the natives of Hindustan, of all races and creeds, will recover from frightful wounds where the European would die.” (Recollections of a Highland Subaltern, 1898.)

F. W. Burroughs, 93rd Highlanders, during the storming of the Secunder Bagh: “Burroughs was born in India and was sent to France for the military part of his education. This accounted for his excellent swordsmanship. [The French excelled at fencing, which is why most fencing terminology was in French.] Burroughs was an accomplished maître d’armes [brevet de pointe]. His height was under five feet, but what he wanted in size he made up in pluck and endurance. He was the first officer of the regiment inside the Secundrabâgh, and was immediately attacked by an Oude Irregular sowar armed with tulwar and shield, who nearly slashed Burroughs’ right ear off before he got properly on his feet. [He stumbled and fell after scrambling through the breach.] It was the wire frame of his feather bonnet that saved him. The sowar got a straight cut at his head, but the sword glanced off the feather bonnet and nearly cut off his right ear. However, Burroughs soon gathered himself together (there was so little of him!) and showed his tall opponent that he had for once met his match in the art of fencing. Before many seconds, Burroughs’ sword had passed through his opponent’s throat and out at the back of his neck. Notwithstanding his severe wound, Burroughs fought throughout the capture of the Secundrabâgh, with his right ear nearly severed from his head and the blood running down over his shoulder to his gaiters; nor did he go to have his wound dressed till after he had mustered his company and reported to the colonel how many of No. 6 had fallen that morning.

“In addition to their muskets, all the men [insurgents] in the Secundrabâgh were armed with swords; and the native tulwars were as sharp as razors. When they had fired their muskets, they hurled them amongst us like javelins, bayonets first, and then drawing their tulwars, rushed madly on to their destruction, slashing in blind fury with their swords. As they rushed on us, they actually threw themselves under the bayonets and slashed at our legs. It was owing to this fact that more than half of our wounded were injured by sword cuts.” (Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny, 1893.)

Lt. Gen. (formerly Capt.) Burroughs’ account: “As soon as three or four men [of his company] had wriggled through the breach, I advanced with them in pursuit of the sepoys, with whom we immediately entered into a hand-to-hand fight. In this scuffle, I received a tulwar cut on the head from one of the enemy as I was cutting at another. My feather bonnet saved my head and my life. It was dented in like a bishop’s mitre. I was slightly stunned; but I am thankful to say I escaped with but a slight wound, cutting open my right ear and cheek. Private Higgins, I believe, shot the man who cut me down.” (Capt. Roderick Hamilton Burgoyne, Historical Records of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders, 1883.) Note how this differs from Forbes- Mitchell’s account. Perhaps it’s the old story of the tale growing with the telling, or perhaps Burroughs’ memory was at fault.
Lt. Col. W. Gordon-Alexander regarding his encounter and observations during the storming of the Secunder Bagh, when he was a lieutenant in the 93rd Highlanders: “Through the smoke, I saw the flash of a tulwar down upon [Captain] Burroughs’ feather bonnet, which was knocked off, and losing sight of him, thought he had been cut down, so lunged with my claymore at the sepoy who seemed to me to have done it, at the same time firing at him point blank with my revolver. [Gordon-Alexander was careful to write “who seemed to me to have done it”, lest he be accused of upstaging Pvt. Higgins or even Burroughs himself, if we are to believe Forbes-Mitchell!] Burroughs was not ‘severely’ wounded [as first reported], because the tulwar cut, coming down on the top of his feather bonnet, the wires of which it bent inwards, glanced off and merely slit his ear and cut his cheek, instead of splitting his skull in two, as it would most certainly have done had we then been wearing any of the hideous and inefficient substitutes for the feather bonnet, which Highland regiments have, since 1858, been condemned to wear on active service.

“Just as [Lieutenant] Græme [of the 1st Madras Fusiliers] got into the gateway [of the Secunder Bagh], an officer [Lt. Cooper] of the 93rd, leading his party, came running along the inside from the direction of the breach. Some of the enemy turned on him; and while he was engaged with one, another raised his tulwar. Græme tried to warn him by calling out, but in vain. He got a slash over the face, which seemed to slice the skin, causing a great piece to fall down over his face, blinding him with blood.

We turned our horses to the right to meet this. For my own part, being on the right, I now got the lead and rode straight at the enemy’s leader, thinking to run him through the body before he could swing his carbine round on me. The point of my sword struck him full in the breast; but to my surprise, the next moment I found myself unarmed, and looking round, saw my sword sticking fast in the man’s body, he still on his horse; but in the midst of the enemy there was no time to look after him. I drew my revolver and rode down to where I saw [Major] Hodson and [Captain] Wise and some of our men hotly engaged with the enemy. I shot down one man attacking Wise, and the next moment felt a spear strike me on the left rear. Throwing my body round to defend myself, I saw Hodson’s sword descend upon my assailant’s head; and down he went, falling half over me. My throwing myself round like this had, it so happened, exposed me to some fellows I had had my eye on just before—three of them, side by side. One of them, seeing me turn, rode up quite close and fired. I felt a tremendous bang on my right shoulder, and for a moment was not quite sure what had happened. For a few minutes it was a very sharp scrimmage, but then the survivors of the enemy turned. Hodson received a severe sabre cut on the fleshy part of the forearm, but made very light of it.” (Maj. F.

Mackenzie regarding his single combats at Lucknow in 1858, when he was a lieutenant in the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry: “A hard gallop soon brought us up with the flying enemy, and here I had rather a narrow escape from abruptly ending my military experiences. Two ‘Pandies’ [mutineers], whom I was pursuing, suddenly turned round and stood at bay, and almost simultaneously lashed at me with their tulwars as I charged between them. The man on the right brought his sword down on my head, fortunately protected by a thick ‘puggeri’ [turban], many folds of which it divided, and then glanced down onto my horse’s shoulder, inflicting a long and deep wound. At the same moment, I delivered a swinging cut on his own cranium, which was covered by a small skull cap. That settled him effectually. But I had barely time to throw my sword round and receive on it a sweeping blow from the fellow on my left, which partially overpowered my guard and landed on my ribs, luckily much diminished in force; so that I escaped with a trifling flesh wound. He did not get another chance; for I dropped the point of my blade and ran him through the body. I was well out of that scrimmage, but my unlucky horse was quite disabled; so I had to dismount and entrust him to the care of one of my men, whose animal I borrowed for the rest of the day.

“In campaigns like those of the Mutiny, in which our [Indian] irregular cavalry was so freely used and played so important a part, hand-to-hand conflict was much more frequent than in ordinary wars. In fact, every officer of that branch had numberless opportunities of testing his skill at arms; for skirmishes were often of almost daily occurrence, and in each skirmish he carried his life literally at the point of his sword.

“To resume: A few minutes afterwards, another adventure of a ‘touch and go’ nature befell me. In a mêlée, a brother officer had singled out a rebel foot soldier and was hotly striving to cut him down; but his antagonist, with bayonet fixed, kept him at bay, and had just brought his musket to his shoulder to fire, when most luckily in the very nick of time I saw what was going on and charged the Pandy, who, disconcerted by the sudden attack, hurriedly attempted to shift his aim onto me, but ineffectually. As he pulled the trigger, his bullet sped harmlessly past my face; while I brought the edge of my sword down on his skull with such good will that it clave in two, and he fell dead. …

“Almost at the end of the pursuit [of defeated insurgents], I noticed on my left front a sturdy rascal, seemingly, from his dress, a dismounted cavalry soldier, stalking along with a musket on his shoulder, sullenly disdaining to run. Him I marked for my prey and dashed after; but when I got within a few yards of him, he faced about and covered me with his musket, expressing himself at the same time in very forcible terms of abuse and defiance. This uncompromising attitude on his part made me think it would be more prudent to shoot than to attempt to sabre him; so I wheeled off to the left and circled round him to the right, returned my sword, and drew my revolver. All this time he held his ground, slowly turning on his pivot, and never ceasing to follow my movements with his aim. But he reserved his fire; for no doubt he coolly reflected that, if he missed me, he would be at my mercy. Every barrel [chamber] of my revolver did I empty at him, and every time without hitting him. Between his legs—under his arms—past his head—flew my bullets, till the whole six were expended. Nothing remained but to gallop away to a safe distance, re-load, and renew the experiment, or else to trust to my sword and charge him. I dare say that, if there had been no witnesses about, I would have chosen the former alternative; but there were many men of the regiment close by, and sheer shame prevented me; so I returned the useless pistol, drew my sword, and with my heart in my mouth, went straight at him at full speed. As I raised my arm to smite, he pulled the trigger. Bending myself half out of the saddle on the near side, I escaped the bullet and delivered on his head with all my force a cut which dropped him to the ground. Though mortally wounded, he was not dead; and he fumbled in his cummerbund for a revolver which was sticking out of it; so I dismounted, and as he—dazed and blinded—pulled the pistol out of his waist cloth, I seized his wrist and directed his aim harmlessly into the air. I then wrenched the weapon from his grasp and used another barrel [chamber] of it to put him out of his pain. That revolver was subsequently identified as having belonged to an officer named Thackwell, if my memory serves me right, who had been killed in the city [Lucknow] a few days previously when separated from his comrades.” (Mutiny Memoirs, 1892.)

Mackenzie regarding his single combats at Lucknow in 1858, when he was a lieutenant in the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry: “A hard gallop soon brought us up with the flying enemy, and here I had rather a narrow escape from abruptly ending my military experiences. Two ‘Pandies’ [mutineers], whom I was pursuing, suddenly turned round and stood at bay, and almost simultaneously lashed at me with their tulwars as I charged between them. The man on the right brought his sword down on my head, fortunately protected by a thick ‘puggeri’ [turban], many folds of which it divided, and then glanced down onto my horse’s shoulder, inflicting a long and deep wound. At the same moment, I delivered a swinging cut on his own cranium, which was covered by a small skull cap. That settled him effectually. But I had barely time to throw my sword round and receive on it a sweeping blow from the fellow on my left, which partially overpowered my guard and landed on my ribs, luckily much diminished in force; so that I escaped with a trifling flesh wound. He did not get another chance; for I dropped the point of my blade and ran him through the body. I was well out of that scrimmage, but my unlucky horse was quite disabled; so I had to dismount and entrust him to the care of one of my men, whose animal I borrowed for the rest of the day.

“In campaigns like those of the Mutiny, in which our [Indian] irregular cavalry was so freely used and played so important a part, hand-to-hand conflict was much more frequent than in ordinary wars. In fact, every officer of that branch had numberless opportunities of testing his skill at arms; for skirmishes were often of almost daily occurrence, and in each skirmish he carried his life literally at the point of his sword.

“To resume: A few minutes afterwards, another adventure of a ‘touch and go’ nature befell me. In a mêlée, a brother officer had singled out a rebel foot soldier and was hotly striving to cut him down; but his antagonist, with bayonet fixed, kept him at bay, and had just brought his musket to his shoulder to fire, when most luckily in the very nick of time I saw what was going on and charged the Pandy, who, disconcerted by the sudden attack, hurriedly attempted to shift his aim onto me, but ineffectually. As he pulled the trigger, his bullet sped harmlessly past my face; while I brought the edge of my sword down on his skull with such good will that it clave in two, and he fell dead. …

“Almost at the end of the pursuit [of defeated insurgents], I noticed on my left front a sturdy rascal, seemingly, from his dress, a dismounted cavalry soldier, stalking along with a musket on his shoulder, sullenly disdaining to run. Him I marked for my prey and dashed after; but when I got within a few yards of him, he faced about and covered me with his musket, expressing himself at the same time in very forcible terms of abuse and defiance. This uncompromising attitude on his part made me think it would be more prudent to shoot than to attempt to sabre him; so I wheeled off to the left and circled round him to the right, returned my sword, and drew my revolver. All this time he held his ground, slowly turning on his pivot, and never ceasing to follow my movements with his aim. But he reserved his fire; for no doubt he coolly reflected that, if he missed me, he would be at my mercy. Every barrel [chamber] of my revolver did I empty at him, and every time without hitting him. Between his legs—under his arms—past his head—flew my bullets, till the whole six were expended. Nothing remained but to gallop away to a safe distance, re-load, and renew the experiment, or else to trust to my sword and charge him. I dare say that, if there had been no witnesses about, I would have chosen the former alternative; but there were many men of the regiment close by, and sheer shame prevented me; so I returned the useless pistol, drew my sword, and with my heart in my mouth, went straight at him at full speed. As I raised my arm to smite, he pulled the trigger. Bending myself half out of the saddle on the near side, I escaped the bullet and delivered on his head with all my force a cut which dropped him to the ground. Though mortally wounded, he was not dead; and he fumbled in his cummerbund for a revolver which was sticking out of it; so I dismounted, and as he—dazed and blinded—pulled the pistol out of his waist cloth, I seized his wrist and directed his aim harmlessly into the air. I then wrenched the weapon from his grasp and used another barrel [chamber] of it to put him out of his pain. That revolver was subsequently identified as having belonged to an officer named Thackwell, if my memory serves me right, who had been killed in the city [Lucknow] a few days previously when separated from his comrades.” (Mutiny Memoirs, 1892.)

The havildar was the last; and by the time he got out through the narrow gate, several men came to the assistance of MacBean; but he called to them not to interfere, and the havildar and he went at it with their swords. At length MacBean made a feint cut, but instead gave the point, and put his sword through the chest of his opponent. For this MacBean got the Victoria Cross. I don’t think that MacBean himself thought he had done anything extraordinary.” (Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny, 1893.)

“The havildar was the last to come out [of the gate], and by this time several of our men had come up to help their comrade. ‘Stand back, boys; fair play for the havildar!’ shouted MacBean; thereat he made a feint to cut, but instead lowered his point and ran his opponent through the chest.” (Edward Gilliat, Heroes of the Indian Mutiny, 1914.)",Asia

The sepoy’s sharp tulwar, however, cut clean through the basket hilt and leather lining of the claymore, into Grimston’s hand. The adjutant, McBean, on entering the main breach, was set on by a number of the enemy; but being a powerful man, and armed with a heavy sword, he killed eleven of them one after another. On the only occasion that McBean ever spoke on the subject to me, he remarked, ‘I was there to kill, d’ye see, man; and I did my best in that way.’ In my Reminiscences I have mentioned his indignation at what took him ‘twenty minutes to do’, as he said, being spoken of by [General] Sir R. Garrett ‘as a good day’s work’.” (Records of Service and Campaigning in Many Lands, 1887.)",Asia
876,448,Lucknow,1858.0,Saber,Indian swordsman,Cut,Head,Death,,Foot,Bisection,,,BSF 186,"William Forbes-Mitchell (former sergeant, 93rd Highlanders) regarding “one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of the force of a sword cut from a curved sword of rigid steel”: “There were three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David, James, and John. They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life. David was a sergeant, and his two brothers were privates. When the assault [on the Begum Kothee] took place, in the inner courts of the palace there was one division held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as razors, and circular shields; and the party of the Ninety-Third who got into that court were far outnumbered on this occasion, as in fact we were everywhere else. On entering, James Ready was attacked by a sowâr [trooper] armed with sword and shield. Ready’s feather bonnet was knocked off; and the sowar got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and halfway down through the breast bone.

“John Ready sprang to the assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword, wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man; and he also was cut right through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and right arm were clean severed from the body. The sowar delivered his stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.

“David Ready, the sergeant, seized the tulwâr that had killed both his brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as if they had been mere heads of cabbage. When the fight was over, I examined that sword. It was of ordinary weight, well balanced, curved about a quarter circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as rigid as cast iron. Now, my experience is that none of our very best English swords could have cut like this one. A sword of that quality would cut through a man’s skull or thigh bone without the least quiver, as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow. The sword blade which bends is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert and powerful swordsman. A blade of spring steel will not cut through the bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand and will not cut through. The rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can bend into a circle, tip to hilt, and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.

[Forbes-Mitchell was correct that “one of the most important requisites in a sword blade for real service is stiffness”. However, “flexibility is frequently assumed as the criterion or test of a good blade. The error arises from confounding flexibility of the blade with elasticity of the steel— the latter is necessary, the former useless and always injurious.” (John Latham, “The Shape of Sword Blades,” Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, 1862.) And Forbes-Mitchell overlooked another important aspect in considering “spring steel to be totally unfitted for a sword blade”: “The function of the cannelure {groove} is to obviate overflexibility {of the blade}; it also takes from the weight and adds to the strength.” (Richard F. Burton, The Book of the Sword, 1884.) Latham, another sword master as well as sword maker (for Wilkinson), agreed that “by putting a groove on each side {or either side of a sword blade}, we not only make it lighter, but we also make it stiffer”.]

“I may also mention the case of a young officer named Bankes, of the Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of Ghâzis [religious warriors]. One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved tulwar. I don’t know if the young fellow got over it [“He did not,” noted Forbes-Mitchell’s editor]; but he was reported to be still alive, and even cheerful, when we marched from Lucknow.” (Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny, 1893.)",Asia

When the assault [on the Begum Kothee] took place, in the inner courts of the palace there was one division held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as razors, and circular shields; and the party of the Ninety-Third who got into that court were far outnumbered on this occasion, as in fact we were everywhere else. On entering, James Ready was attacked by a sowâr [trooper] armed with sword and shield. Ready’s feather bonnet was knocked off; and the sowar got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and halfway down through the breast bone.

“John Ready sprang to the assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword, wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man; and he also was cut right through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and right arm were clean severed from the body. The sowar delivered his stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.

“David Ready, the sergeant, seized the tulwâr that had killed both his brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as if they had been mere heads of cabbage. When the fight was over, I examined that sword. It was of ordinary weight, well balanced, curved about a quarter circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as rigid as cast iron. Now, my experience is that none of our very best English swords could have cut like this one. A sword of that quality would cut through a man’s skull or thigh bone without the least quiver, as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow. The sword blade which bends is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert and powerful swordsman. A blade of spring steel will not cut through the bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand and will not cut through. The rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can bend into a circle, tip to hilt, and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.

[Forbes-Mitchell was correct that “one of the most important requisites in a sword blade for real service is stiffness”. However, “flexibility is frequently assumed as the criterion or test of a good blade. The error arises from confounding flexibility of the blade with elasticity of the steel— the latter is necessary, the former useless and always injurious.” (John Latham, “The Shape of Sword Blades,” Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, 1862.) And Forbes-Mitchell overlooked another important aspect in considering “spring steel to be totally unfitted for a sword blade”: “The function of the cannelure {groove} is to obviate overflexibility {of the blade}; it also takes from the weight and adds to the strength.” (Richard F. Burton, The Book of the Sword, 1884.) Latham, another sword master as well as sword maker (for Wilkinson), agreed that “by putting a groove on each side {or either side of a sword blade}, we not only make it lighter, but we also make it stiffer”.]

“I may also mention the case of a young officer named Bankes, of the Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of Ghâzis [religious warriors]. One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved tulwar. I don’t know if the young fellow got over it [“He did not,” noted Forbes-Mitchell’s editor]; but he was reported to be still alive, and even cheerful, when we marched from Lucknow.” (Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny, 1893.)",Asia

The cavalry were ordered to charge; but the rebels reached them before they could be put in motion, and the three troop officers [of the 7th Hussars]—Slade, Wilkin, and Bankes—were cut down. The latter lost a leg and an arm, and died of his wounds shortly after. It was only owing to the courage of Colonel James Hagart, commanding the 7th Hussars, that he was brought out alive. Hagart rode to Bankes’ rescue almost, if not quite, single-handed, cutting his way through the enemy two or three times. Three of the rebels he shot with his revolver, and knocked over a fourth with the hilt of his sword, which was attached to his wrist by a silk pocket handkerchief. Everything he had about him bore traces of his gallant struggle. His saddle and his horse were slashed about both in front and behind, his martingale was divided, his sword hilt dented in, the pocket handkerchief severed as cleanly as with a razor, and a piece of the skin of his right hand cut away. Two Sikh sowars [of Hodson’s Horse] now rode up, one of whom attacked the daroga, while the second engaged another powerful rebel; but finding that their enemies were getting the best of it, these two gallant Irregular horsemen dismounted and renewed the combat on foot. The daroga three times struck down his antagonist, who defended himself with his shield, until, when a favourable opportunity presented itself, the Sikh gave his foe a back-handed cut across the neck, which laid him low. The other Sikh also despatched his opponent.” (Incidents in the Sepoy War, 1873.)

“Cornet Bankes and his horse were cut down, both mortally wounded, and Lieutenant Wilkin had his foot nearly severed as he was warding off a blow aimed at the prostrate cornet.” (Gen. Sir Evelyn Wood, The Revolt in Hindustan, 1908.)

“Bankes and his charger were cut down. Wilkin charged to his side; but in warding off the attack from his wounded comrade, his horse reared.

This caused him to miss his aim; and at the same time, he received a severe wound in the foot. Wheeling again to the rescue, he cut down the rebel who was on the point of killing Bankes. Wilkin, though wounded, and joined by Hagart, once again charged the rebels and cut down nearly all those who remained. For his gallant conduct, Wilkin was twice recommended for the Victoria Cross; but he received neither recognition nor reward.” (Col. G. B. Malleson, History of the Indian Mutiny, 1896.)

His saddle and his horse were slashed about both in front and behind, his martingale was divided, his sword hilt dented in, the pocket handkerchief severed as cleanly as with a razor, and a piece of the skin of his right hand cut away. Two Sikh sowars [of Hodson’s Horse] now rode up, one of whom attacked the daroga, while the second engaged another powerful rebel; but finding that their enemies were getting the best of it, these two gallant Irregular horsemen dismounted and renewed the combat on foot. The daroga three times struck down his antagonist, who defended himself with his shield, until, when a favourable opportunity presented itself, the Sikh gave his foe a back-handed cut across the neck, which laid him low. The other Sikh also despatched his opponent.” (Incidents in the Sepoy War, 1873.)

“Cornet Bankes and his horse were cut down, both mortally wounded, and Lieutenant Wilkin had his foot nearly severed as he was warding off a blow aimed at the prostrate cornet.” (Gen. Sir Evelyn Wood, The Revolt in Hindustan, 1908.)

“Bankes and his charger were cut down. Wilkin charged to his side; but in warding off the attack from his wounded comrade, his horse reared.

This caused him to miss his aim; and at the same time, he received a severe wound in the foot. Wheeling again to the rescue, he cut down the rebel who was on the point of killing Bankes. Wilkin, though wounded, and joined by Hagart, once again charged the rebels and cut down nearly all those who remained. For his gallant conduct, Wilkin was twice recommended for the Victoria Cross; but he received neither recognition nor reward.” (Col. G. B. Malleson, History of the Indian Mutiny, 1896.)

Maj. Gen. Osborn Wilkinson, formerly a staff officer in the 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the Army of Oude: “Captain Slade, well ahead of his men, was immediately surrounded and unhorsed, with a deep sabre cut in his thigh, which would have clean severed any ordinary-sized leg. It was not without difficulty that he was rescued by his hussars. These Ghazees fought like devils, but they had no chance against us—for we were about ten to one— and every man Jack of them was killed. I remember seeing one fellow with several hussars and sowars around him at once, fighting savagely for dear life. One sowar got behind him and gave him an awful slash down the back, but it did not seem to quench his fiery spirit; he bravely struggled on, till he was completely overwhelmed.” (Memoirs, 1896.)",Asia

My sword was whipped out of my hand—I was ‘giving point’ at the time—the man fell, but I am sure my sword did not pierce him. (I had an opportunity soon afterwards of recovering it; but it was twisted, and I could not get it into the scabbard again.) When deprived of my sword, I pulled out my pistol and pointed it at the Pandies [mutineers]; but it refused to go off, which shook my faith in the efficiency of a revolver. Fortunately, the enemy were falling back about this time; and I, therefore, was in no peril; but it was an awkward position. I came into contact with two or three Pandies that day. I remember two instances in which the rebels, in avoiding my intended blow, came into collision with my horse, which knocked them head over heels as if they had been ninepins; and I rode slap over them both. I do not really believe they were as much hurt as I was, for in one case I did succeed in delivering my cut; but whether the fellow bobbed, or whether my cut was unskilfully administered, I cannot say. He fell, but my sword blade glided off his head onto my foot; and I found when I got home a clean but slight cut on the side of my foot, and my sock and inside of my boot were stained with blood.” (Memoirs, 1896.)",Asia

Waiting until the next puff of smoke told that the man was unloaded, they both rode at the bush where the smoke still lingered, Jack firing his revolver as he advanced. The Oudh man rose from his lair, threw down his gun, and drew his tulwar. Jingo, in passing, delivered a regulation sword exercise cut with his ponderous blade. Young Jingo was proud of his swordsmanship; he could cut through the thick part of a hanging leg of mutton, bone and all, and now he expected to see that ambusher’s head fly from his shoulders. Instead, the tulwar deftly turned the sword; while a round white spot of bare skull, the size of a rupee, showed that the poor fellow had lost his long tuft of hair. His turban, wound round his head, had left the top unprotected. Circling his horse, Jingo passed his sword through the poor devil’s body just above the cummerbund. One of Jack Hallowes’ small revolver bullets had struck the breast bone, and another had penetrated the turban without reaching the skull.

His turban, wound round his head, had left the top unprotected. Circling his horse, Jingo passed his sword through the poor devil’s body just above the cummerbund. One of Jack Hallowes’ small revolver bullets had struck the breast bone, and another had penetrated the turban without reaching the skull. It was hardly a fair scrimmage, and could not well have been avoided, yet the pair felt disgusted. Mais, à la guerre comme à la guerre [But, in war as in war].

“‘Queen’s Own Hussars, by your centre, draw swords! Steady, men! Walk march! Trot! Canter! Charge!’ And away they dashed after their brave colonel and the squadron leaders, straight for the guns! The lieutenant [Strange] thought he might legitimately enjoy the novel luxury of a cavalry charge, so he put himself on the right of the line and drew his sword. The enemy had now seen what was up; and a clump of Ghazee infantry threw themselves in front, and the tulwars flashed round the fluttering green flag, the Englishmen riding over them or knocking them down with slogging blows from the flat, the back, anything but the edge of the sword. If by accident the edge did lead, it would neither cut through the folds of the turban nor the quilted cotton coats they wore. The regulation cavalry sword cannot keep its edge through being perpetually drawn from and returned with a smart flourish to the steel scabbard; and the handle, too large and round, generally turns in the hand. The squadron leaders alone killed their men. They knew enough to deliver point.

“The galloping gunner [Strange] had leisure to note these things; for the flank on which he rode overlapped the Ghazees, and he found no opponent for his steel. Fearful of a wigging for amateur dragooning, he reined round and saw the unharmed Ghazees picking themselves up. But not for escape. Hodson’s Horse were coming up in support. With wild shouts, in rather open order, on swept the irregulars, mostly Sikhs, without sympathy for Oudh Poorbeah [Easterner]. Their keen tulwars, making drawing swoops, always in a direction supplemented by the speed of the horse, did work the clumsy British blades could not do. A Ghazee, rising from the ground, turned to fly, his tulwar raised to protect his head. A passing sowar severed from the wrist the hand holding the sword. The hand, still clutching the weapon, flew off some feet; and a jet of blood spurted from the artery. Another man, just staggering to his feet, had his back laid open diagonally from shoulder to waist, and the spine severed. Nothing escaped the torrent of horsemen, whose front rank used with deadly dexterity the lance. It was held tent-pegging fashion, except that here the weapon was deftly extracted by the rider bending forward and letting his right arm go with the butt over his back and the point to the rear, when the weight of the stabbed body and the speed of the horse extracted the lance.",Asia

It was parried, but he gave no return. I went at him again, but he again parried. I then resolved to end the thing at once. I got on his right side, and raised my sword as if to give “cut two”, sir; but, as his arm was lifted to parry, I dropped the blade and gave point just above his cummerbund. He was the time of a flash of lightning too late. The forte of his sword reached my blade in parry, but the latter had already entered his body several inches. I knew he would have a last cut at me, notwithstanding. I withdrew my weapon quickly, and formed my guard. He raised his sword above his head for a final blow, but it dropped from his hand; and with a low sigh, he fell from his charger.’” (“My Troop Sergeant-Major, By the Editor,” Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine, 1886.)",Asia

The Riflemen were extended in skirmishing order on the right, and entered the jungle. Lieutenant Green had warned the men not to lose communication with their files; but in the thickness of the jungle, three men got separated and were surrounded and wounded by the enemy. Hearing firing, Lieutenant Green at once made for the place, and was immediately surrounded by six rebels. He shot two with his revolver. As he was in the act of dismounting to attack the others, he was cut down and hacked at while on the ground. Springing to his feet, however, he managed to knock down two more of his assailants with the butt of his revolver; and drawing his sword, he kept the others at bay. While he was about to fall back in search of some of his men, he was attacked by three more of the enemy and a second time cut down. Again getting to his feet, he contrived with his wounded right hand to shoot another man, who was in the act of cutting at him with his tulwar, and whose blow, descending as he fell dead, inflicted a deep wound on Green’s head.

I called to my orderly, ‘Go and kill him,’ and without checking my horse, looked round to see what would happen. Dhokul Singh rode at him with uplifted sword, prepared for ‘cut 2’ (a cut at the head). The man held his fire till his adversary got within three yards and then fired, missing his aim. Dhokul Singh’s sword, cutting his face into two bits, knocked him to the ground.

The [tall] Wilayati gave me a personal challenge, coupled with opprobrious language, calling to our men, ‘Come on, you dogs of the Government!’ I had started my horse at the same moment, and reached the five men standing in the corner of the group. They came to the motions of ‘Ready—Present’ in the methodical manner in which our soldiers were trained; and as I lunged at the nearest man, five fired.

The Wilayati, cutting too soon, missed my leg, and overbalancing, fell on his face. I backed my horse, and got the point of my sword within a couple of inches of his back, when two of the sepoys, running out of the group, thrusted at me with their bayonets; and I was obliged to bring the point of my sword back to keep them off.

“The Wilayati jumped up and came behind me; but as he did so, I saw, over the heads of two sepoys with whom I was personally engaged, Dhokul Singh [Wood’s orderly] approaching at speed from the west or far side of the group, through which he charged like a skittle ball amongst the pins. He knocked down two without seriously hurting them, riding straight at the Wilayati, who was now close behind me, with his sword again in the air. Dhokul Singh cut ‘5’ (body cut), but missed his stroke; and I exclaimed sarcastically, ‘Bravo!’ The soldier was furious at my remark, and as he circled his horse and ‘collected’ it to a slow canter, shouting ‘The Sahib says “Bravo”!’, rode directly on the Wilayati, who stood with his long sword in the air. Neither man condescended to guard; each cut with all his strength, Dhokul Singh using ‘cut 2’, as he had when he fought the dismounted rebel. The Wilayati’s sword, falling on the cap lines of my orderly’s shako, severed them, cut through the cantle (rear peak) of the saddle, dividing the crupper and slightly wounding the horse’s spine. Dhokul Singh’s sword cleft the Wilayati’s face in twain, felling him to the ground.

“Then, a troop of the 8th Hussars, led by Lieutenant Harding, Adjutant, came up. He and the men, who, having been my fellow passengers on board ship for two months, knew me, were cheering; and Harding, calling me by my nickname ‘Sailor’ [Wood had been a midshipman in the Crimean War before transferring to the army], shouted, ‘You take that one, and I’ll take this fellow,’ pointing to two rebels, who, having run for about 50 yards, were then standing at bay. Harding rode down at the man he had selected, who waited to fire until they were so close that Harding, in raising his sword for ‘cut 2’ at the man, had his jacket set on fire by the rebel’s cartridge, and fell mortally wounded. My man stood 50 yards from where the group had dispersed when I rode amongst them, and with his right foot placed on an ant-bear heap, awaited me with fixed bayonet. I approached him at a smart canter, with elbows close to my sides to protect the lungs, and the point of my sword low down under the horse’s forearm. I guided the horse so as to take the point of the bayonet on its chest; but the sepoy, when he saw that I was ‘riding home’, wavered and attempted to club his musket. As he swung it, butt uppermost, over his head, the point of his bayonet caught in the cummerbund which he wore over his coatee. This delayed him for a second; and my sword, entering under the left armpit, went through him up to the hilt, the butt of his musket falling over my shoulder, but without hurting me seriously, as my horse stopped.

“As the sepoy dropped off the point of my sword, I galloped after the others. Four stood 60 yards farther on, with their backs to conifers. The nearest awaited the attack till the colour of my sword blade unnerved him; and he withdrew out of reach, under the spreading branches of a cedar, where he was speared by a native lancer, his comrades falling at the same time. [For these encounters, Wood was awarded the Victoria Cross and Dhokul Singh was promoted to duffadar or corporal.] Lieutenant E. R. C. Bradford [of Mayne’s Horse], a fellow Marlborough boy, talked over our adventure that evening. Mayne’s Horse, about 200, came on a gol [wedge formation] of the enemy’s infantry, covering the retreat. Bradford broke through the thickest of the enemy, 18 or 20 deep. He was followed by 20 Sikhs; and though there were some men and many horses slightly wounded, Bradford was untouched. Said I, ‘Edward, when you went through the gol, did you cut or thrust?’ Most men would have swaggered a little; but he replied simply, ‘I shut my eyes and galloped.’ …

“I rode at a sepoy who escaped into a jowarry field. I pursued him, but when I got into the middle of the field, regretted having done so; for the stalks were stiff and strong, and I had to spur my horse sharply to induce him to move. If the sepoy had realised my difficulty, and awaited my coming, I must have fought at a disadvantage. He went through the grain, however, and halted on a clear spot. As I approached, he threw down his musket, which was empty, and drawing a sword, cried, ‘Sahib, I know I must die; but it is not an officer’s duty to kill individuals. Send a private to fight me. I shall either wound or kill you.’ I replied, ‘It is more likely I shall kill you,’ as I cantered at him. He was an active man, and threw himself down on his back so suddenly as to escape the point of my sword, irritating me by cutting at my horse’s hocks. [And yet he didn’t mind attempting to guide that horse onto a bayonet point!] Now I had given £110 for the horse; and having no money to replace it, I lost my temper, calling to the sepoy that I had taken him for a warrior and not a horse slaughterer. Before I could turn the horse, my men, who had come up, by getting round the rebel in a circle, effectually prevented my fighting him by approaching at speed, as all cavalry soldiers should do. He kept five or six at bay for some minutes by snicking their horses’ faces, until he fell to a pistol shot.

“[In a night raid on an enemy outpost,] I attacked the nearest rebel. We cut at each other three times in succession, the boughs [of a tree] intercepting our swords; and as he drew his hand back the fourth time, I, going close to him with the point of my sword behind my right foot, cut upwards, wounding him in the fleshy part of the thigh. He staggered to my left, which brought him before [Havildar or Sergeant] Burmadeen Singh, who twice cut in vain at him, his sword catching in the trees, when I shouted, ‘Point, give the point.’ Burmadeen Singh now disappeared [in pursuit of the rebel]; and I ran after him, tumbling into a natural drain, on top of my sergeant and the rebel, whom he was killing. Scrambling up, I ran after the last fluttering white clothing I could see; for I was apprehensive that if once they stood, I might yet be beaten. Failing to overtake them, I turned back, and having broken the remaining firelocks and swords, started homewards.” (From Midshipman to Field Marshal, 1906.)

MacIver, a volunteer with the Hyderabad Contingent Cavalry, at the battle of Jhansi (otherwise known as the battle of the Betwa [River]) in 1858: “The battle was at its height, and during the mêlée MacIver got separated from his troop. Whilst he was urging his horse forward and trying to rejoin his comrades, he was attacked by two sowars, who set upon him fiercely, and against whom he had to defend himself as best he could. Although but a lad of sixteen, the rebels had more than met their match; for General Graham [MacIver’s uncle and private military instructor] had not failed to make him a perfect master of the sword. The young Highlander, with a cut of his sabre, slew one of his enemies quickly, and then engaged the other—a big, burly fellow—in a hand-to-hand fight. Now that the odds were equal, it was only an affair of a few brief moments before MacIver’s sabre was run through the chest of his second foe. But before he could give the wrench in the recover and withdraw his blade, the sowar seized MacIver’s sabre with both hands, forcing the hilt against his own breast so as to bring himself close to his opponent, and then spat in the face of his enemy, exclaiming: ‘Toom Feringhee sooer wallah!’ (You European pig[man]!) The next instant he released his hold of MacIver’s sabre, threw up his arms in his death agony, and fell back from his horse dead.

“Striking his spurs into his charger, the young soldier again dashed into the midst of the fray; and the next minute he was attacked by no less than seven well-mounted sowars. Not a friend was at hand that could help him, for each man near had as much as he could do to hold his own; and at the moment, MacIver saw nothing but death before him. However, he determined to fight to the last and sell his life as dearly as might be; and he defended himself with such persistent obstinacy and bulldog courage, yet so coolly and adroitly, that he not only kept his enemies at bay, but speedily reduced their number. One after another, he managed to empty three of the saddles, cutting down or unhorsing his men, when the remaining four sowars, probably realising that unless they made a united attack they were likely to get the worst of it, suddenly spurred in a body upon their youthful but determined foe. As the sowars, their tulwars raised, made their rush, instinctively the lad’s sabre went up to protect his head. Unfortunately, at the same moment, a pistol bullet struck him on the sword hand, ploughing its way along the palm, breaking down his guard and leaving him defenceless and at the mercy of his exasperated enemies.

Quick as lightning, a tulwar flashed through the air, cutting clean through the young officer’s topee [sun helmet] and down into his skull; and MacIver rolled out of the saddle and fell upon the earth, apparently dead. But shortly before the battle, as a protection from the fierce heat of the sun, MacIver had placed a damp towel under his felt helmet; and this no doubt had been the means of saving his life. Yet so keen had been the steel, and so well directed the hand that wielded the weapon, that the sharp blade had divided helmet and towel and cut down into the skull, although fortunately without serious injury to the brain. Yet what a ghastly wound must that have been, the vivid scar from which will be carried through life!” (Under Fourteen Flags, 1884.)

At the first blow he cut a man’s head in half, as handsomely as if he had been used to the work. He was then shot and taken to the hospital, so he had the laugh of me; for I was a bit of a swordsman, but was disabled by sword cuts that very same day.” (Col. Henry M.

In one of these bouts I had just put my sword into the ribs of one of these fellows (an artilleryman); and he clung to the bare blade, holding it in his body and cutting his fingers to the bone in doing so, at the same time making frantic attempts to bite my leg. Fortunately my boot protected it; but he held my trousers in his teeth as tenaciously as a bulldog would, and I had to use the spur of my other boot in his face to make him relinquish his hold. This will give some idea of the savage nature of our warfare in these little skirmishes.” Not only that, but since the insurgent was lying on the ground in hiding when Stent pierced him, how he reacted was just another typical example of the riskiness of giving point! Stent added in a footnote: “The popular belief among natives is that drawing the weapon out causes death (not plunging it in, I suppose), and that as the weapon comes out, so also does the life blood; but all the while the weapon remains in, the recipient of it will live. This man evidently wished to have some satisfaction at the very last moment of his life.” If true, all the more reason not to thrust! (Scraps From My Sabretasche, 1882.)",Asia

Dartnell, 86th Foot, at the storming of Jhansi in 1858: “When the order to assault was given, Dartnell ran ahead of the Light Company [of the 86th] and ascended the only available ladder; for the rebels had overturned or smashed the others [with rocks and logs]. The ladder did not quite reach the top of the wall, at that place 30 feet high; and the upper rungs, which had been damaged, gave way under Dartnell’s weight. In the language of a newspaper correspondent at the time, ‘An officer (name unknown), a mere boy, as the ladder broke, sprang at the battlement, clutched it, and active as a cat, obtained a footing on the wall.’ Dartnell dropped from the top of the wall down into a bastion, alighting in the midst of astonished Bundelas [Central Indian Rajpoots], who crowded so closely around him that they could not at once hit him without injuring each other. Dartnell fought hard for his life, but was felled to the ground, wounded in five places. A Bundela sliced 7 inches into Dartnell’s upper left arm, cutting nearly to the bone; another slashed his forearm deeply; and a third foeman nearly severed the subaltern’s left hand from the wrist. Then a matchlock man fired against Dartnell’s body; but the bullet, striking the centre plate of the waist belt, was deflected and merely grazed the abdomen. A fifth antagonist, cutting open the youth’s right arm, knocked him helpless under foot of the crowd, who were striving to finish their bloody work, when the other officers of the 86th Regiment dropped from the wall’s summit into the fray and saved his life.” (The Revolt in Hindustan, 1908.)

“Young Dartnell of the 86th, finding himself alone, with no means of defence but a regulation sword, tried to get his back to the wall; but his foot slipped; and he had to defend his head with his arm, which was cruelly hacked.” (Lt. Harry Prendergast, Madras Engineers, quoted in Col. Henry M. Vibart’s Life of General Sir Harry N. D. Prendergast, 1914.)

“Dartnell defended himself as best he could with his sword for a few moments, but was soon overpowered and fell to the ground. There had been too many of them [assailants], and they had been in each other’s way, otherwise they would undoubtedly have killed the brave young subaltern. Today he bears deep scars showing how savage the attack upon him was.” (H. P. Holt, The Mounted Police of Natal, 1913.)

At the first course, Cheke ran Dutton into the neck with his rapier, and stabbed him in the neck backward with his dagger, miraculously missing his windpipe; and at the same instant, like one motion, Dutton ran Cheke through the body, and stabbed him into the back with his left hand, locking themselves together thus with four bloody keys, which the seconds fairly opened, and would fain have closed up the bleeding difference; but Cheke’s wounds were deadly, which he finding, grew the violenter against his enemy; and Dutton, seeing him begin to stagger, went back from his fury, only defending himself, till the other, rage weakened with loss of blood, without any more hurt, fell at his feet. Dutton, with much difficulty, recovered from his dangerous wounds; but Cheke, by his servants, had a sad funeral, which is the bitter fruit of fiery passions.” (Arthur Wilson, History of Great Britain, 1653.)

Another account, by historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle: “Two gentlemen, stript to the shirt and waistband; in the two hands of each, a rapier and dagger clutched; their looks sufficiently serious! The seconds, having stript, equipt, and fairly overhauled and certified them, are just about retiring from the measured fate circle, not without indignation that they are forbidden to fight. [With or without permission, seconds frequently fought each other along with the principals.] Two gentlemen in this alarming posture, of whom the Universe knows, has known, and will know nothing except that they were of choleric humour and assisted in the Netherlands wars! They are evidently English human creatures, in the height of silent fury and measured circuit of fate, whom we here audibly name: Sir Hatton Cheke, Sir Thomas Dutton, knights both, soldadoes both. Ill-fated English human creatures; what horrible confusion of the Pit is this?

“Dutton, though in suppressed rage, the seconds about to withdraw, will explain some things if a word were granted. ‘No words,’ says the other; ‘stand on your guard!’, brandishing his rapier, grasping harder his dagger. Dutton, now silent too, is on his guard. Good Heavens; after some brief flourishing and flashing—the gleam of the swift clear steel playing madly in one’s eyes—they, at the first pass, plunge home on one another; home, with beak and claws; home to the very heart! Cheke’s rapier is through Dutton’s throat from before, and his dagger is through it from behind—the windpipe miraculously missed; and, in the same instant, Dutton’s rapier is through Cheke’s body from before, his dagger through his back from behind—lungs and life not missed; and the seconds have to advance, pull out the four bloody weapons, disengage that hell embrace of theirs. This is serious enough! Cheke reels, his life fast flowing, but still rushes rabid on Dutton, who merely parries, skips, till Cheke reels down, dead in his rage. ‘He had a bloody burial there that morning,’ says my ancient friend [historian Arthur Wilson]. He will assist no more in the Netherlands or other wars.” (Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, 1865.)",Europe

I took horse at Whitehall Gate, and passing by that place, he being armed with a sword and dagger, without giving me so much as the least warning, ran at me furiously, but instead of me, wounded my horse in the brisket, as far as his sword could enter for the bone. My horse hereupon starting aside, he ran him again in the shoulder, which, though it made the horse more timorous, yet gave me time to draw my sword. His men thereupon encompassed me, and wounded my horse in three places more. This made my horse kick and fling in that manner as his men durst not come near me, which advantage I took to strike at Sir John Ayres with all my force; but he warded the blow both with his sword and dagger. Instead of doing him harm, I broke my sword within a foot of the hilt. Hereupon some passenger that knew me, and observing my horse bleeding in so many places, and so many men assaulting me, and my sword broken, cried to me several times, ‘Ride away, ride away’; but I, scorning a base flight upon what terms soever, instead thereof alighted as well as I could from my horse.

“I had no sooner put one foot upon the ground, but Sir John Ayres, pursuing me, made at my horse again, which the horse perceiving, pressed on me on the side I alighted, in that manner that he threw me down, so that I remained flat upon the ground, only one foot hanging in the stirrup, with that piece of a sword in my right hand. Sir John Ayres hereupon ran about the horse, and was thrusting his sword into me, when I, finding myself in this danger, did with both my arms reaching at his legs pull them towards me, till he fell down backwards on his head. One of my footmen hereupon, who was a little Shropshire boy, freed my foot out of the stirrup; the other, which was a great fellow, having run away as soon as he saw the first assault. This gave me time to get upon my legs, and to put myself in the best posture I could with that poor remnant of a weapon.

“Sir John Ayres by this time likewise was got up, standing betwixt me and some part of Whitehall, with two men on each side of him, and his brother behind him, with at least 20 or 30 persons of his friends, or attendants of the Earl of Suffolk. Observing thus a body of men standing in opposition against me, though to speak truly I saw no swords drawn but by Sir John Ayres and his men, I ran violently against Sir John Ayres; but he, knowing my sword had no point, held his sword and dagger over his head, as believing I could strike rather than thrust, which I no sooner perceived but I put a home thrust to the middle of his breast, that I threw him down with so much force that his head fell first to the ground and his heels upwards. His men hereupon assaulted me, when one Mr. Mansel, a Glamorganshire gentleman, finding so many set against me alone, closed with one of them; a Scotch gentleman, also closing with another, took him off also. All I could well do to those two which remained was to ward their thrusts, which I did with that resolution that I got ground upon them.

“Sir John Ayres was now got up a third time, when I, making towards him with intention to close, thinking that there was otherwise no safety for me, put by a thrust of his with my left hand, and so coming within him, received a stab with his dagger on my right side, which ran down my ribs as far as my hip, which I feeling, did with my right elbow force his hand, together with the hilt of the dagger, so near the upper part of my right side, that I made him leave hold. The dagger now sticking in me, Sir Henry Cary, afterwards Lord of Faulkland and Lord Deputy of Ireland, finding the dagger thus in my body, snatched it out. This while I, being closed with Sir John Ayres, hurt him on the head and threw him down a third time; when, kneeling on the ground and bestriding him, I struck at him as hard as I could with my piece of a sword, and wounded him in four several places, and did almost cut off his left hand. His two men this while struck at me, but it pleased God even miraculously to defend me; for when I lifted up my sword to strike at Sir John Ayres, I bore off their blows half a dozen times. His friends, now finding him in this danger, took him by the head and shoulders, and drew him from betwixt my legs, and carried him along with them through Whitehall, at the stairs whereof he took boat. Sir Herbert Croft (as he told me afterwards) met him upon the water, vomiting all the way, which I believe was caused by the violence of the first thrust I gave him. His servants, brother, and friends being now retired also, I remained master of the place and his weapons, having first wrested his dagger from him, and afterwards struck his sword out of his hand.

James Somerville, commander of the garrison in Edinburgh Castle, and one Capt. Craufuird in 1640—the result of Somerville, a Covenanter, calling Craufuird, a Cavalier, “a dastardly fool, fit only for Bedlam,” after Craufuird called Somerville “a Jam fouteur” (Jacobite rake) and “a cullion [rascal] to the boot”: “It would appear this gentleman [Craufuird] conceived his affront being public, no satisfaction acted in a private way could save his honour; therefore, to repair the same, he resolves to challenge and fight Somerville upon the High Street of Edinburgh, and at such a time when there should be most spectators. In order to this design, he takes the occasion to assault him in this manner: having a long broadsword and a large Highland dirk by his side, he comes up to Somerville, and without farther ceremony, says, ‘If you be a pretty man, draw your sword,’ and with that word, pulls out his own sword with the dagger. Somerville at first was somewhat startled at the impudence and boldness of the man that durst so openly and avowedly assault him, being in public charge and even then on his duty. But his honour and present preservation gave him no time to consult the conveniency or inconveniency he was now under, either as to his present charge or disadvantage of weapons, having only a great cane staff in his hand, which for ordinary he walked still with, and that same sword which General Ruthven had lately gifted him, being a half-rapier sword, backed [i.e., single-edged], which hinging in a shoulder belt far back, as the fashion was then, he was forced to guard two or three strokes with his cane before he got out his sword, which being now drawn, he soon puts his adversary to the defensive part by bearing up so close to him and putting home his thrusts that the captain, for all his courage and advantage of weapons, was forced to give back, having now much ado to parry the redoubled thrusts that Somerville let in at him, being now agoing.

“Somerville drives down the captain, still fighting, near to the goldsmiths’ shops, where, fearing to be nailed to the boards (these shops being then all of timber), he resolved by a notable blow to revenge all his former affronts, making therefore a feint, as if he had designed at Somerville’s right side, having parried his thrust with his dagger, he suddenly turns his hand; and by a back-blow with his broadsword, he thought to have hamshackled him in one if not both of his legs, which Somerville only prevented by nimbly leaping backward at the time, interposing the great cane that was in his left hand, which was quite cut through with the violence of the blow. And now Providence so ordered it that the captain, missing his mark, overstruck himself so far that in time he could not recover his sword to a fit posture of defence, until Somerville having beaten up the dagger that was in the captain’s left hand with the remaining part of his own stick, he instantly closes with him; and with the pommel of his sword, he instantly strikes him down to the ground, where at first (because of his baseness) he was minded to have nailed him to the ground, but that his heart relented, having him in his mercy. And at that same instant, there happened several of his own soldiers to come in, who were so incensed that they were ready to have cut the poor captain all in pieces, if he had not rescued him out of their hands and saw him safely convoyed to prison, where he was laid in the irons and continued in prison in a most miserable and wretched condition somewhat more than a year.” He was then exiled!

Close-wedged from the first in an enemy’s column, and on all sides hemmed in by the Russians, General Scarlett was neither killed nor maimed; for the sabre which stove in his helmet was stopped before reaching his skull, and the only five wounds he received were so slight as to be for the time altogether unheeded. By some chance, or possibly as a consequence of wearing a headgear which announced the presence of a staff officer, Lieutenant Elliot, the aide de camp of the Brigadier, was beset with great determination by numbers gathering round him on all sides; and although his skill as a swordsman and the more than common length of his blade enabled him for a while to ward off the attacks of his many assailants, they at length closed about him so resolutely that it seemed hardly possible for a single horseman thus encompassed by numbers to defend himself many more moments; but at this very time, as it happened, his charger interposed in the combat. The horse had become so angered by the pressure of the Russian troop horses closing in upon his flanks and quarters that he began to lash out with his heels, and this so viciously as not only to ward off attacks from the rear, but even in that direction to clear a space. There were four or five Russians, however, who resolutely addressed themselves to the task of extinguishing Elliot; and at a moment when he had somewhat over-reached himself in returning the thrust of a Russian trooper, he received a point in the forehead from his adversary. At the same time, another of his assailants divided his face at the centre by a deep-slashing wound; whilst a third dealt a blow on the head which cut through his cocked hat; and then, by the sabre of yet a fourth assailant, he was so heavily struck in the part of the skull behind the ear that, irrespectively of the mere wound inflicted by the edge of the weapon, his brain felt the weight of the blow. There followed a period of unconsciousness, or rather a period erased from the memory; for Elliot remained in his saddle, and it is hard to say how he could have been saved if the effect of the blow had been so disabling as to prevent him from using his sword arm.

Then followed the pursuit of ‘the gentleman in the blue coat’. As the major pursued, the Arab turned in his saddle and took steady aim at him with his rifle over his left shoulder; he swung his horse to the off-side of the ‘Buddoo’ [Bedouin], who turned in the saddle again and aimed at him point blank. ‘I had already tumbled to it,’ the major explained, ‘that the rifle wasn’t loaded; and as he didn’t fire, I became certain.’ So he dug his spurs in, rode at him, and stuck him from behind; and that was the end of ‘the gentleman in the blue coat’. The major strained his wrist drawing out his sword. That is always the difficult point. ‘It went in like butter,’ a subaltern of horse told me, describing a similar incident at Barjisiyeh Wood. ‘I didn’t know I’d got him, but I was almost pulled off my horse drawing it out.’ And he told me how the natural instinct for the cut sometimes overbore the tradition that demanded the thrust, and how, in the pursuit after a little affair near Shaiba, he gave way to the impulse—‘wanted to see the fellow’s head roll off his neck’. He felled him all right, but I gathered that he was disappointed in the spectacular effect. The fellow’s head was as hard as a croquet ball, he explained. And ever since, he has been faithful to the manual and the thrust.” Even though “the thrust” nearly unhorsed him and might have cost him his life! But illogic overrode instinct.

We were in a very bad position at the time; they [i.e., the Russian cavalry] formed up in front of us, and outflanked us; we had not more than ten yards to go in at them. Our second squadron made the first attack—we were very soon alongside of them; it was then you would have heard the clash of swords. Our swords sprung off their great grey coats; but we put the points to work, which very soon entered them; and in a very short time, the field was covered with grey coats. It was hard work for a short time, but we soon put them to flight.

I can answer for myself that there was a large number after me. As they were galloping nearly one on the top of another to see who would have me first, I must have wounded many of them, as I did nothing but parry their points and return my own as quickly as I could. There was an officer who dashed into the centre of us, when the Russian lancers came down on our left, and wounded a man named Kennedy; he took the skin off one side of his head; he had also wounded or killed several others, but I could not say how many. I had pointed him with a ‘right-rear point’; and just as the Russian retreat sounded, I saw the same officer endeavouring to get in front of me. When he heard the sound, he turned short to the left and met me right hand to right hand, and made a terrible point at me. But I had my eye on him; for I knew I had pointed him in rear of the guns, and he would have me if he could; but, thank God, I was too quick for him! I parried off his point, and with a return point, drove my sword through his mouth. I still kept on the swing, and saw nothing more of him.

Lieutenant Alexander Roberts Dunn turned his charger, one of the most notorious kickers in the regiment, and rode back towards the belated sergeant, who was endeavouring to parry the blows of three Russian dragoons. The lieutenant spurred straight for the first dragoon and sabred him out of his saddle, allowing Bentley time to recover his legs, after which he turned his attention to the other two. They closed, and hacked, and circled round and round, Dunn’s charger now and then lashing out and almost unseating him, blood mingling with the foam that flecked rider and steed.
